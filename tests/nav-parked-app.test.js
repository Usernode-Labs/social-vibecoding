'use strict';

// #platform-parked — the app you left, one tap above the tab bar (#2718), and
// at the foot of the desktop rail.
//
// The bar makes the platform's five places one tap each, and in doing so it
// makes the app you were IN the one thing that is not: no tab, no header strip
// once you leave, and Home's grid is every app rather than the one you were
// halfway through. This is the handle back.
//
// #2762 is why most of this file exists. The strip, its store and its CSS all
// shipped with #2718, and no app was ever parked: every way out of an app
// nulls `App.currentApp` before its transition starts and runs AppView.close()
// (which nulls AppView.appData) before the screen swap that parked, so the
// parking code always found nothing to park. Its tests only ever parked
// through the bridge by hand, which is why nobody saw. The tests below drive
// the REAL router in a vm, through every route out of an app.
//
// What is pinned, and each is a way it can be quietly useless:
//
//   1. THE ROOT SHIPS EMPTY. It is in the frozen shell inventory, so it has to
//      be in the prerendered document — with nothing inside it, because the
//      app comes from localStorage and a read during a first render is a
//      hydration mismatch.
//   2. THE WHOLE STRIP RESUMES, back INTO the app, from wherever you are.
//   3. LEAVING PARKS, BY EVERY ROUTE OUT — the close button, each tab, Back,
//      and the hop from the running app to its own Workshop — with the name
//      and icon the app was drawn with.
//   4. ENTERING THE APP CLEARS IT. Resuming the app you are in is a shortcut
//      to where you already are.
//   5. IT RIDES ON THE BAR: never over the running app, the signed-out shell,
//      the keyboard, or a folded desktop rail.
