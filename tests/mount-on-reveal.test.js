// A screen's interior mounts on its FIRST REVEAL, not in the prerender.
//
// public/index.html carried 1,485 elements, and 681 of them — #settings-
// screen's sixteen panes (437) and the six anonymous-shell screens (244) —
// sat hidden behind roots a signed-in visitor on the board never reveals.
// Every load parsed, styled and hydrated them anyway. frontend/src/lib/
// mount-on-reveal.ts is the seam that stops that: the root stays in the
// document exactly as it was, and the children render once the root is
// revealed or a legacy caller asks for them.
//
// Three things are pinned here, because each is a way the change could
// quietly undo itself:
//
//   1. THE STORE. `mounted` is one-way, notifies synchronously, and the
//      server snapshot honours an explicit mark — which is what lets a test
//      render an interior (tests/lib/lazy-interiors.js) while the SSG pass,
//      which marks nothing, keeps emitting the empty root.
//   2. THE CALLERS. Settings.open()/route() and AuthScreens.show() were
//      written against markup that was always there and read its ids on
//      their next line, so each asks for the interior FIRST. Lose that line
//      and the screen opens empty with a null dereference behind it.
//   3. THE DOCUMENT. Each root ships as an empty element, and each screen
//      renders its interior only when marked — the win, and the hydration
//      contract (first client render == prerender) in one assertion.
//
// Run with: node --test tests/mount-on-reveal.test.js
