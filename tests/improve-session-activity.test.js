// #1946 + #1947 — a change row says WORK, not lifecycle, and says it once.
//
// App feedback triage 2026-09-10 filed the Improve panel's corner badge twice,
// once per colour, because it was one indicator with two readings:
//
//   row 39a  "Replace static green dot with active work indicator."
//   row 39b  "Clarify misleading yellow dot status." — remove the yellow
//            session dot, show "sessions actively thinking" some other way,
//            "pairs with triage row 39a's activity indicator".
//
// The dot was the 12px badge on each row's 32px app tile: emerald on every
// idle row (a success colour for NOT working, which never moved and never
// meant activity), amber on a running one — 8px from a pill that was already
// saying `Working` in a word, in the same amber, with the platform's arc
// turning in it.
//
// So the badge is retired and the pill is the row's one activity indicator.
// It is the indicator 39a asked for: #1958 wired it to the live session store
// (`SessionState.isBusy`), so it follows the turn boundary's push rather than
// whatever the last /api/me/active-sessions answer happened to say — actual
// work activity, not a lifecycle. And it is how 39b's "actively thinking"
// reads now: the arc, plus the word beside it that a screen reader gets.
//
// Rendered, not grepped — the point is what a row puts on screen in each
// state. tests/improve-session-spinner.test.js (#1597) owns the arc's class
// and gating; tests/improve-ready-for-input.test.js (#1959) owns the words.
//
