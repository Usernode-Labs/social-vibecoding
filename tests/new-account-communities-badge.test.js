// The Communities tab's badge on a brand-new account (5 Oct 2026).
//
// Two new accounts on production opened their first session under an accent
// "5" and an "8" on the Communities tab. They had joined nothing and been
// asked nothing: every account with platform access is put in Homeroom, the
// platform's own community, and every change proposed to the platform was a
// vote they owed, so the tab asked for them about a community they never
// chose, on the screen that asks "What do you want to make?".
//
// The rule: a community you are in only as every account is ('auto') and
// have not taken part in yet is UNCHOSEN, and its votes do not put a number
// on the tab. They are still counted everywhere you go to look. The
// server's half (which communities are unchosen) runs against Postgres in
// tests/new-account-communities-badge-postgres.test.js; this file EXECUTES
// the client's half (tests/lib/render-tsx.js `loadTsx`): the scope store
// that reads the flag, the number the tab draws from it, and the tab itself.
//
// Run with: node --test tests/new-account-communities-badge.test.js
