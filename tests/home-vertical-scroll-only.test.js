// The home feed scrolls one way, and CSS does not give you that for free.
//
// ── The bug ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// On a phone the home screen could be dragged left and right as well as up
// and down: a swipe sideways slid the whole feed a couple of pixels and
// rubber-banded it back. Two things had to be true at once.
//
//   1. #home-screen is `flex-1 overflow-y-auto` and nothing else, and CSS
//      turns that into a scroller on BOTH axes — `overflow` computes
//      `visible` to `auto` on one axis the moment the other stops being
//      `visible`. So the feed had always been a horizontal scroll container
//      by accident, waiting for something inside it to be a pixel too wide.
//
//   2. On a phone something is. `.un-touch-target` (native.css) grows any
//      control to a 44px hit box with an absolutely positioned ::after
//      CENTRED on it, so the ⋮ that opens an area's menu — `w-4`, 16px, and
//      the last thing in its row — reaches 14px past itself on each side.
//      The section's gutter is `px-3`, i.e. 12px. 12 < 14, so the box landed
//      2px beyond a 390px viewport and the screen measured 392px of
//      scrollWidth.
//
// ── What is pinned, and what is deliberately not ───────────────────────
//
// The FIX is the container: a vertical feed says so, rather than being one
// as long as nothing inside it happens to overhang. That is what these
// assert. The overhang itself is not a bug and is not pinned — it is a hit
// area, it is meant to hang off its control, and clipping costs 2px from the
// outside of a target that still extends 12px past a 16px button on that
// side.
//
// The original hide-menu control is now retired (#1801). The feed must
// still contain horizontal overflow from any remaining or future content.
//

// The rule above makes the feed scroll one way. This is the other half of

// can take the feed's axis away from it. `touch-action` is not a preference
// about which direction an element would like — it is the complete set of
// gestures the browser may run for a touch that STARTS on it, intersected
// down the ancestor chain, so a nested horizontal rail declaring `pan-x`
// denies the vertical pan outright rather than passing it up to #home-screen.
//
// Discover's card rail did exactly that, under a comment asserting the
// opposite ("a VERTICAL drag still reaches the page"). Two rails of ~13rem
// cards is most of the Discover block, so a finger landing on a card could
// not scroll the page at all.
