// #1406 / #1408 — two small UI tweaks, of which ONE survives.
//
//   #1406  kept the improve button and the view selector alive on the other
//          platform screens (settings, profile, messages). The Streamlined
//          Concept took the other side of that decision on purpose — a
//          platform screen carries a plain title and an empty right slot,
//          navigation lives in the drawer — so `_publishPlatformChrome`, the
//          header-resident selector and their checks are gone. What survives
//          of #1406 is the navigation guard it fixed in Improve.openApp,
//          asserted below.
//   #1408  Text boxes grow with their content up to a ceiling.
//
// #1407 was here too — centring the title in the space the side groups LEAVE
// rather than on the viewport, which is a different place because the groups
// are lopsided. It was implemented, reviewed on the staging preview and backed
// out: the anchor moving with the right group's width read as the title
// wandering rather than as it being centred. use-header-layout.ts keeps the
// viewport-centred rule it always had — absolute at left:50% when the title's
// natural width clears the wider group on both sides, flex flow otherwise —
// and nothing in this file asserts on it.
//
// Run with: node --test tests/header-and-textbox-tweaks.test.js
