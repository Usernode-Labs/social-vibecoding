// The shell's element-id inventory, pinned.
//
// Every id in public/index.html is an API. public/js/** reaches for them with
// getElementById (57,799 lines of it, none of which the type checker sees),
// public/css/app.css styles some of them, and dapp.json's 227 declared tests
// select against deep chains of them — so a single lost id is a silently
// broken screen plus a blocked merge, and it is by far the most damaging way
// a markup conversion can go wrong.
//
// So: the set of ids the generated document carries must equal the set the
// hand-written one carried, exactly — minus whatever a conversion chunk has
// deliberately retired, plus whatever it has deliberately added.
//
// ── The baseline, not the fixture (#1078) ──────────────────────────────
//
// Step 1 compared against a byte copy of the pre-migration document
// (tests/fixtures/pre-migration-index.html). Step 2 converts screens on
// purpose, so whole-document comparison is the thing that has to go — but the
// id inventory outlives it. The id list now lives in
// tests/baselines/shell-markup.json, derived once from that fixture by
// scripts/derive-shell-baseline.js; the fixture itself is gone.
//
// EVERY CHUNK RECORDS ITS OWN ID CHANGES HERE, in the same commit, with a
// reason. That is the whole mechanism: the baseline stays frozen, and the two
// maps below are the reviewable log of what the migration moved.
//
// Run with: node --test tests/shell-id-inventory.test.js
