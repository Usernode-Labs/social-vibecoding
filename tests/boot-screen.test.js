//
// ── The lie this replaces ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The prerender ships `#home-screen` visible and every other root hidden,
// because a static render has no route to read. public/sw.js then serves that
// document to every navigation it can win, so the home feed was the first
// thing painted on EVERY address — a board deep link, a settings link, a
// signed-out visitor headed for the marketing page.
//
// Measured on a 4x-throttled cold load of `/app/<slug>/board`: home visible at
// 263ms, home's own launcher skeleton filling in at 1744ms, the app view
// finally taking over at 2225ms. Two seconds of watching the wrong page load,
// and the skeleton made it worse — a screen that is visibly working is a
// screen you believe.
//
// ── Why it runs where it runs ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// At app.js MODULE SCOPE, not on DOMContentLoaded and not after hydration.
// app.js is a classic script at the end of <body> and the React entry is a
// deferred module, so this is the earliest moment the roots exist. The two
// later seams were both measured and both lose: `init()` awaits
// `/api/auth/me` (a 2s budget) before it can route, and hydration itself
// landed at ~2000ms in the same trace. With a slow session endpoint the right
// screen is up at 653ms instead of ~2450ms.
//
// Run with: node --test tests/boot-screen.test.js
