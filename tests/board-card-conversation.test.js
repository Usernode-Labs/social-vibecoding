// One card, one set of controls, on every view (#1884).
//
// The Workshop's rows carried the item's conversation — the recent GitHub
// comments above, the app's own thread with the reply box below — and the
// Board's rows carried neither. So the SAME card read as two different
// objects: opened from the Workshop it had somewhere to reply, opened from
// the Board it had nothing under it at all. Nothing about the CARD differed;
// what differed was the ROW the two surfaces built around it, which is the
// kind of drift a shared component cannot prevent on its own.
//
// Both surfaces route through `_attachRowConversation` now. This file pins:
//
//   * every board column's rows carry what the Workshop's carry, per kind —
//     an issue its GitHub comments AND its thread, a proposal or governance
//     item its thread, a merged row neither (its conversation lives on the
//     proposal it came from);
//   * the Underway column's sessions carry theirs, private ones included;
//   * an unfolded board card actually renders both regions;
//   * the legacy filler is wired from the board and paints wherever the slot
//     lives, not only under `#dev-workshop`;
//   * the comment and thread CSS is scoped to both hosts, at the weight it
//     had when the one id stood alone;
//   * a declared check reads the reply box off a board card.
//
