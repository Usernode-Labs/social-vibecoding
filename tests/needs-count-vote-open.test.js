// test:changed: when public/js/app-view.js (the client's "waits on your vote" predicate, loaded through lib/app-view-vm.js)

// A project's "Needs you" count and its Needs you page agree: the count
// appears when the vote does.
//
// A tester saw "1" beside Needs you in a project's menu and "Needs you · 1 to
// vote" on its Hub while the Needs you page said nothing was waiting, for two
// to three minutes, and had to leave and come back before the vote showed.
// The count was worked out on the client from the board's /promoted rows the
// moment a change was promoted; the page (GET /api/workshop/needs-feed) lists
// a change only once its vote is open (work_states.vote_open), and read once.
//
// What this pins:
//   1. THE ROW. /promoted carries `vote_open`, by the feed's own fragment.
//   2. THE COUNT. The client's "this waits on your vote" predicate, which the
//      Needs-you queue, the place's badge, the Hub's For you card and the
//      Communities tab's number are all built from, requires it. The board
//      still lists the change, and a row without the field reads as open.
//   3. THE PAGE. A project's Needs you reads its feed again on a work_state
//      push about that project, quietly, and its run takes in what arrived
//      without dealing a card again.
//   4. THE EMPTY LINE names the project on a project's own page.
//
// tests/needs-count-vote-open-postgres.test.js runs the row, the predicate
// and the feed together against a real database.
