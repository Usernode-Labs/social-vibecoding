// An update Homeroom bot could not make to its own change is said plainly,
// with a real next step (5 Oct 2026).
//
// After "Ask for changes" or a reply on the change, a follow-up that said it
// revised but moved nothing posted, to everybody in the project: "Homeroom
// bot tried to update this change but couldn't: the turn produced no change.
// It is as it was. A person could make the update from here." The run's own
// record, and a dead end. #3900 fixed the same for a build
// (tests/build-failed-words-everywhere.test.js). Pinned here, the same way:
//   - the post (homeroom-bot-followup.js revisionFailedText) and the DM
//     (homeroom-bot-dm.js dmText 'followup_failed') say the cause in the same
//     words, from the same reading of the record (buildFailedCause, through
//     updateFailedWords), and never the record itself;
//   - the next step each names is true: a reply in the change's discussion
//     or on the request wakes the bot (ws.js), and its next look is a
//     follow-up that reads that reply; Ask for changes on the change posts
//     what they write there and puts that follow-up first;
//   - a change it may not revise again says so, instead of a retry that
//     would not happen;
//   - the DM carries the change's card and rings as a stop.
//
// Run with: node --test tests/homeroom-bot-revision-failed.test.js
