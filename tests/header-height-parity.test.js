// Header height parity (#909) — the shell's top bar is the same height on
// every screen.
//
// The two authored top bars — #platform-header (signed-in shell: home, app
// view, leaderboard, profile, settings, admin console) and #landing-header
// (anonymous shell) — are `pt-2 pb-4` around a 28px CONTENT ROW, i.e.
// 52px + env(safe-area-inset-top), everywhere. One app.css rule trims the
// kit's safe-area top padding to match pt-2 for both bars (#2305).
//
// It was `py-3` (52px) until the bottom padding grew. #platform-header also
// carries `-mb-2`, which pulls the screen below it 8px UP into the bar to cut
// the `rounded-b-2xl` notch — so the controls had 12px of padding minus an
// 8px overlap, i.e. four pixels, between them and whatever came next. On the
// routes where that next thing is a raised sheet with a 28px radius and a
// shadow reaching up (inside an app, inside a proposal session) the chip, the
// bell and Improve sat on its lip. `pb-5` restored 12px; #2305 ("the top bar
// steals too much vertical space") settled on `pb-4`, which leaves 8px.
//
// It was 53px until the reskin, when both bars lost the 1px `border-b`
// hairline they had carried: the widget language draws no rule under a top
// bar — the page ground runs to the top of the screen and the controls float
// on it. What this file pins is PARITY and the 28px row, not the constant, so
// the hairline assertion below inverted rather than disappeared: it now
// asserts NEITHER bar has one, which is what catches a rule re-added to one
// shell and not the other.
//
// Neither header declares a height: they're flex rows, so the row is
// max(child heights) and the height silently followed whichever children
// happened to be present on that screen:
//
//   home                 53px  (#header-title's text-lg = 28px line box, +
//                               the hairline both bars carried back then)
//   inside an app        55px  (#app-mode-switch was 30px: py-1 segments
//                               = 24px + p-0.5 = 4px + 1px border × 2)
//   landing, >= 640px    61px  (CTAs were sm:py-2 sm:text-sm = 36px)
//   home, native WebView 45px  (html.in-native-webview USED to hide the
//                               title, leaving only 20px icon buttons; the
//                               title is drawn there now, and the 28px
//                               content-row floor is what holds the height)
//
// So the row is pinned from BOTH directions and this file is what keeps it
// pinned — a "tidy up the header" edit that re-adds vertical padding to a
// header child, or drops a taller control in, fails here instead of shipping
// a bar that jumps as you navigate:
//
//   FLOOR   — the lead back-button wrapper (present in every state of both
//             headers) carries h-7, so the row survives the title being
//             display:none. It stays w-5: the header-layout hook
//             (frontend/src/features/header/use-header-layout.ts) measures it
//             as the title's left side group.
//   CEILING — no child of either header exceeds 28px.
//
// Prose version of the same contract lives in the "Header height invariant"
// block in public/css/app.css.
//
// Static-assertion style (cf. tests/header-status-pane.test.js): read the
// shipped source files and assert the contract is present. There is no
