// #3772, again on 5 October 2026: the OpenRouter transport
// (src/services/global-chat/openrouter.js) asks for require_parameters, so
// any parallel_tool_calls it sends, `false` included, routes the call only to
// providers that take that parameter. For GLM 5.3 Flash that is one of its
// thirty-three (Inceptron): every call becomes that one provider's, its 429s
// and slow answers included, with nowhere to fail over.
//
// The DM was fixed first (homeroom-bot-mayor.js askModel). The model
// helpers (llm.js askHelperModel, #3932) and the small-change tag
// (small-change.js, #3918) then copied `parallelToolCalls: false` and hit it
// again: feedback titles timed out or were rate-limited. A caller that
// wants parallel calls says `true`, and only for a model that takes them
// (global-chat/orchestrator.js); everyone else passes null.
