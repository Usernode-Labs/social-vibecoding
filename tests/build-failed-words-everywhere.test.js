// A build Homeroom bot could not finish is said the same plain way wherever
// it is said (5 Oct 2026, Page Turners #3).
//
// The requester's DM said "I tried to build this but couldn't finish (the
// build ran past its time limit (finished after a restart)). A person can pick
// it up from here." #3895 fixed the DM: what happened in plain words
// (homeroom-bot-dm.js buildFailedWords) and "Reply here and I'll try again."
// Three places still had the old words:
//
//   - the bot's post on the request, which everybody in the project reads
//     (and its GitHub comment): "Homeroom bot tried to build this but
//     couldn't finish: <the run's own record>. A person could pick it up from
//     here." (homeroom-bot-live.js buildFailedText);
//   - the push for that DM, and its bell row: "I couldn't finish building it.
//     A person can pick it up" (mobile-push-policy.js botMomentCopy, the
//     bell's botMomentLine; tests/homeroom-bot-notify.test.js holds the two
//     together).
//
// Pinned here: the post says each cause as the DM does, from the same reading
// of the run's record, never the record itself; it says how anybody starts it
// again, and that is true (a person's reply there is activity the bot reads
// again: homeroom-bot.js classifyIssue); the push and the bell row end as the
// DM ends; and no failure surface says "pick it up" any more.
//
// Run with: node --test tests/build-failed-words-everywhere.test.js
