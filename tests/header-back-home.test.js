// Back/home buttons on secondary screens; a shared Home/Browse root header (#1569).
//
// ── What the bar looked like before ────────────────────────────────────
//
// `mode` was a boolean wearing three names. Only 'arrow' drew anything;
// 'home' meant HIDDEN — a leftover from #1443, which retired the house glyph
// because the chip's menu carries a Home row an inch to its right. True, and
// the cost was five screens with nothing in the bar at all: the app itself,
// Profile, Settings, Admin and Messages. Two more drew a CHEVRON with no
// href, which resolved to home — the right destination behind the wrong
// glyph, promising a level above a root screen that has none.
//
// ── The three modes, and why 'home' was redefined rather than added to ──
//
//   'none'   hidden. Home alone. The Browse list was here too until #2639:
//            you navigate INTO it from Home, so it takes the house like
//            every other such screen.
//   'home'   the house, to home. THE DEFAULT — `_showOnlyScreen` publishes it
//            on other screen swaps, so secondary screens keep a way out.
//   'arrow'  the chevron, one level UP to its own href.
//
// ~40 call sites already spelled the default 'home', and every one of them
// meant "no level above this" — which is exactly the screen that should offer
// home. So the meaning moved and the call sites did not, and the ones that
// had to change are the ones that must NOT offer it: Home itself.
//
// ── The bug this file exists to stop coming back ───────────────────────
//
// The bridge in features/header/mount.ts narrowed `mode` with
// `mode === 'arrow' ? 'arrow' : 'home'`. Correct while 'home' meant hidden,
// and a silent bug the moment it draws: setBackIcon('none') from Home arrived
// as 'home' and put a house on the one screen that must not have one. Every
// layer above was right — app.js computed 'none' and published 'none' — and
// one ternary turned it into its opposite. It took a browser to find; it
// takes one assertion to keep found.
