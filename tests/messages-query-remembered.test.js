// The Messages list's search is remembered per device (#5459).
//
// A daily voter narrows the list to the changes waiting on them, leaves to
// vote, and comes back: until now the search was gone and every row was
// back. The query is kept in localStorage (`usernode:messages-query`), the
// way the folded sections are (`tests/messages-folded-remembered.test.js`),
// and read after mount — the filter chips #4783 remembered were removed with
// the section split (16 Oct 2026), and the search is the only filter left.
//
// The same three things are pinned, each a way the remembering quietly comes
// undone:
//
//   1. AN UNUSABLE SAVED VALUE RESTORES NOTHING. Storage is user-writable,
//      and a value no one could have typed (not a string, empty, past the
//      cap) narrows the list to nothing.
//   2. THE WRITE IS GUARDED, INSIDE A TRY, AND THE FIELD UPDATES AFTER IT.
//      Storage may be unavailable (private mode, blocked); a crash in the
//      write must not stop the list from narrowing, and the setQuery runs
//      whether the write worked or not.
//   3. THE INITIAL STATE IS EMPTY. `useState('')` stays, so the first render
//      and the prerendered shell show an empty field; the saved value
//      arrives one commit after mount, so the first paint matches.
//
// Run with: node --test tests/messages-query-remembered.test.js
