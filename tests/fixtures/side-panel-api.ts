// Bundle the side panel's island, its store, its controller and the panel
// document's runtime together, for the reason ./parked-strip-api.ts gives:
// tests/lib/render-tsx.js bundles each entry on its own, so a store imported
// through a second entry would be a SECOND copy, and setting it would change
// nothing the component or the controller can see.
//
// ./mount.ts is deliberately NOT here: importing it installs listeners on the
// global window, and tests/side-panel.test.js installs what it drives by hand.
