// Homeroom bot says when it is working, and does what it says (1 Nov 2026).
//
// Evan, in a private design thread: he asked the bot to render a screen and
// the whole answer was "Let me look at how the app builds its main screen so
// the design matches it.", then nothing. Asked "can you do that? In the
// current thread?", it said "Drawing it now from the app's own markup and
// styles." and drew nothing. Both loops (homeroom-bot-mayor.js, design-bot.js)
// took words with no tool call as the answer; the screen showed a thin "is
// typing" line, if anything. Pinned here, without a database:
//
//   1. Words that only announce the next step (announcesOnly), never a real
//      answer that happens to start "Let me know…".
//   2. Main Chat's loop goes on after them, and its claim check catches a
//      reply that says it is drawing with no draw_screen behind it.
//   3. The designer goes on after words that do not draw (a preamble, a
//      drawing it did not make, a question asking leave), and a real
//      question back still ends its turn.
//   4. What the bot is doing, by tool (doingFor), told to its typing.
//   5. The prompt: a status question in a thread is about that thread; a
//      screen asked for is drawn in that turn.
//   6. The working card in place of the bot's typing line; people keep the line.
