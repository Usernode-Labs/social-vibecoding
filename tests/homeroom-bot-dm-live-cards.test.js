// Three things the Homeroom bot's DM said wrong in the Page Turners run-
// through (5 October 2026), and what each says now.
//
//   1. THE READY CARD CATCHES UP. Alex's "Page Turners is ready to try"
//      card still said "It goes live when one more person approves" at
//      12:14, eighteen minutes after the change went live: a card is a
//      message, sent once. The DM's activity read now also says where each
//      ready card's change stands (homeroom-bot-dm.js readyStates): live
//      (with a button that opens the app), going live, closed, or up for
//      approval with who it waits on as it is now. A vote on the change
//      reads the requester's DM again (noteVoted).
//   2. "IT'S LIVE NOW." HAS A WAY IN. Its app card was refused (a group the
//      bot is not in), and the message went out as plain words. It carries
//      its own Open button now (openAppAction), which opens the app the way
//      the shell does (App.openAppTab).
//   3. DURATIONS COUNT THE WORK. Priya's request was filed at 11:10, held
//      for the first version until 11:56, interrupted by a deploy, built
//      again and up for approval at 12:20: its card said "1h so far" and
//      "took 1h 9m". The clock starts when the work did, a restart carries
//      it on, and the wait is said apart (homeroom-bot-activity.js
//      workClock): "took 24m, after waiting 46m for the first version".
