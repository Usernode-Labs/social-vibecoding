// The Communities screen's scope chip and its Needs you row (#2718, #3051).
//
// The screen answers "which of my apps wants something from me": a chip that
// says what you are looking at and narrows it, a row that totals the votes
// owed, and one row per app carrying both of its numbers.
//
// ── What this suite used to pin, and why it does not ──────────────────
//
// A TAB STRIP (Current status / Needs you / All items) and a PLUS. Both are
// retired from this screen on the owner's review, and the reason is worth
// keeping because it is the argument that would bring them back: those three
// words are the APP Workshop's, about one app's items. Up here the list is of
// APPS, each row already showing both figures, so the tabs hid whole apps to
// say what their rows were saying anyway — and the plus asked "which app?"
// before two questions ("propose a change", "report a problem") that can only
// be asked inside an app.
//
// AND THE SCOPE CHIP (#2759). It read "All apps" here and its panel listed
// your apps — but this screen IS that list, every row the way into its app's
// Workshop, so the chip was the page repeating itself.
//
// ── #3051 brought two of those back, on the owner's request ──────────
//
// The chip, reading "All apps", and two of the tabs: Current status and
// Needs you. The UI overhaul took the tabs away again: your in-flight items
// moved to Profile's Your changes, which left Current status holding only
// the list, so the list is the page and Needs you is ONE ROW at its top
// ("3 votes waiting on you") that opens the cross-community feed as a page
// with a way back. Nothing filters the list of apps, which is the argument
// above. All items and the plus stay retired: every item of every app is not
// a page, and the plus's two questions can still only be asked inside an app.
//
// ── #852 made the tab a community, and the chip's panel a switcher ─────
//
// The fourth tab is the community you are on (or All communities), and
// "Your communities" is how you change which: a sheet on a phone, a menu on a
// wide window, opened from the lit tab, the header's name and ⌄, and the All
// chip here (features/workshop/community-switcher.tsx). The "Which project?"
// panel both ends of the chip shared is gone. Its audience sections and "Show
// N more" (#3363) went with it for a round and are back in the switcher
// (#3519): every community you are in, in the Communities screen's sections,
// newest first, each saying who it is for and what it waits on you for.
//
// What is pinned, each a way the screens can be quietly wrong:
//
//   1. PICKING A COMMUNITY GOES TO ITS HUB, and All communities to the list.
//   2. THE SWITCHER SAYS WHICH ONE YOU ARE ON, and what each waits on you for.
//   3. THE NEEDS YOU ROW SAYS NOTHING OVER A ZERO, and totals every
//      project, not a filtered few.
