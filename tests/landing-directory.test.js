// Source pins for the landing page's persistent header + its two ways in:
//   - the bar is the wordmark over the back disc and carries no CTA; the
//     wordmark gives way to the open app's name, which is why #app-viewer
//     needs no bar of its own,
//   - the ways in are two pills in the body: "Join the waitlist" to the
//     MARKETING site (target="_blank", so the native shell hands it to the
//     bridge) and "Sign in" to #login, with one text line for somebody who
//     already joined,
//   - the marketing URL comes from the server and no host is written into
//     the frontend; until it arrives the pill is inert rather than pointed
//     at the in-app #waitlist form this screen stopped sending people to,
//   - a signed-in but not-yet-admitted visitor sees neither pill: their
//     action area is one pill back to the waiting room,
//   - #app-viewer is an in-flow flex sibling of the scroller and opens /
//     closes with the kit zoom transition (with the outEl the flex-sibling
//     measurement pitfall requires),
//   - ?shot=anon-back drives the viewer through the opener, not through a
//     rendered tile, because there is no longer a directory grid,
//   - the directory is still FETCHED (the shot picks its target from it and
//     pull-to-refresh re-runs it) but renders nothing,
//   - LandingTile survives as the gated-launch contract: gated apps dim,
//     badge a lock, and route taps to #signup with the deep link remembered,
//   - the shell probe is wired at boot and its columns exist in schema,
//   - staging seeds one open + one gated app so both branches exist.
//
// These are content pins (same style as tests/chromeless-share-links
// .test.js): they hold the contract in place so a refactor that silently
// drops a piece fails loudly here.
