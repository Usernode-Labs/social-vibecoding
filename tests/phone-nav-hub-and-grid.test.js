// A PHONE GETS AROUND A COMMUNITY FROM ITS HUB (Evan, 3 Nov 2026: "lose one
// layer of sidebar").
//
// Under 768px a community's places were a drawer beside its page. The drawer
// is gone (tests/nav-drawer.test.js pins the header that is left): the Hub is
// how a phone reaches the places, and All communities, a grid of tiles, is
// where it switches community. These pin the two halves of that:
//
//   - the Hub's rows: For you's Workshop row, always there for a signed-in
//     viewer and named for the place it opens, and a Topics card, a row a
//     live topic, each opening its channel (frontend/src/features/dev-board/
//     workshop/hub-cards.tsx TopicsCard, drawn by ./workshop.tsx on a phone
//     only);
//   - All communities as a grid on a phone (frontend/src/features/workshop/
//     index.tsx CommunityTile), whose tile is a door to the Hub.
//
// Run with: node --test tests/phone-nav-hub-and-grid.test.js
