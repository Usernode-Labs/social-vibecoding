// The vm harness's copy of the grid store's initial state must not drift.
//
// tests/helpers/home-grid-store.js transcribes INITIAL_GRID because the real
// one lives in TypeScript (frontend/src/features/home/grid-store.ts) and the
// vm sandboxes run classic script text — there is nothing to import it from.
// A transcription is a second source of truth, and the failure it invites is
// silent: a field added to the real store but not to the copy simply reads
// `undefined` inside every home test, so `Home.render()` publishes it, nobody
// asserts on it, and the harness keeps passing while the thing it models has
// moved on.
//
// So pin the pair. This parses the literal out of the TypeScript source rather
// than evaluating it: the file is a module with type-only exports around it,
// and the object itself is plain JSON-shaped data.
//
// Run with: node --test tests/home-grid-store-initial.test.js
