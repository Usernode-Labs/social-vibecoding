// A problem reported on a change that is not live yet revises that change
// (first-session run-through, 5 October 2026).
//
// Sam, an invited flatmate, tried the group's first version (a change
// Homeroom bot built, waiting for approval) and found its main button did
// nothing. He pressed Ask for changes, which attached the change to his
// message to the bot, and wrote "Tapping mark as done doesn't do anything
// for me". The bot's model never saw the attached card: it called it "a bug
// in the app itself", offered a NEW request, and after "Yes please" drafted
// one, whose activity card then read "You asked: Yes please".
//
//   B  a message carrying one of the bot's own changes still waiting for
//      approval goes to that change (reviseProposal, the path Change
//      something on its ready card takes): posted in its discussion as his,
//      its follow-up first, and one line from the bot saying what happens
//      next, with no model turn. A question about it, and anything a gate
//      refuses, goes to the model, which now reads the card under the
//      message (sharedItemLines) and is told the change is what to revise;
//   C  "You asked:" on the activity card is the request as it was filed,
//      never the message that confirmed it;
//   D  no em dashes from the bot: the prompt says so, and a spaced one in a
//      reply becomes a comma.
//
