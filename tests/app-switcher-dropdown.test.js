// The Homeroom menu is a POPOVER under the mark on desktop (#2784).
//
// #apps-switcher-sheet is one always-mounted element with three
// presentations, all of them decided in app.css: a kit bottom sheet on touch,
// a CSS bottom sheet below `sm`, and at `sm`+ for a mouse a popover hanging
// under the Homeroom mark that opened it. That last one has moved twice: from
// a full-height right-edge rail to a dropdown centred under the header's
// title chip, and — once the trigger moved from the chip to the mark at the
// far right of the bar — from the middle of the screen, dimming the page, to
// right under the mark with no dim, the way the dev board's vote popover
// hangs off its button. The research behind that last move (how mini-app
// hosts present their platform menu) is in the #2784 proposal.
//
// Nothing about the markup changed, which is the point — these pin the CSS
// contract, the one measurement the island makes, and the traps in it:
//
//   1. A popover cannot hide by sliding off an edge (it has none, and it
//      paints above the header), so the closed state is opacity +
//      visibility. `.platform-sheet-adopted` flattens transform, position,
//      border and shadow but NOT those two — so a touch device wider than
//      639px, which matches the desktop rule and the kit adoption at once,
//      would present an invisible sheet without an explicit reset.
//   2. Where the mark is depends on the header's layout, so the popover is
//      placed from the mark's measured rect — through lib/anchor-popover.ts,
//      the arithmetic the vote popover uses — not from restated geometry.
//   3. No dim at `sm`+, and the backdrop lets the pointer through there, or
//      every outside click (the bell included) would be a dead click. Below
//      `sm` it is still a bottom sheet and its backdrop still dismisses it.
//
// And the fallback offset is the header's own height, restated once as
// --platform-header-h, which is only worth having if it cannot drift from the
// markup it describes. The first test is what makes that true.
//
// Run with: node --test tests/app-switcher-dropdown.test.js
