//
//   - the same design guidance the dev chat builds with, its self-check
//     chosen by whether the build's model reads images (OpenRouter's
//     catalog, read as the Mayor reads it);

//     a change a person will see is looked at, in both looks, before the
//     turn ends;
//   - for a project's first version, a design brief of its own in the
//     triage note and the spec, and a build that builds with the starter's
//     design kit and records the look in the "## Design" section of the
//     app's CLAUDE.md for every later change to follow.
