// The four-band dev card (public/js/app-view.js + public/css/app.css).
//
// Every card on the dev board is now the same shape, top to bottom:
//
//   1 head    — type icon + title, clamped to TWO lines
//   2 meta    — the "PR#123 · author · 2h ago" subtitle, ONE line
//   3 status  — ONE merged band: the state bar, the Closes-#N pills and the
//               metadata chips, sharing a single row
//   4 actions — ONE row of action pills
//
// The point is alignment BETWEEN cards, not within one: a kanban column used
// to stack a card with a subtitle, three chips and a full-width tally row
// beside a card with a bare title, and nothing lined up. So bands 2 and 4 are
// RESERVED — they render, and hold their row open, even when the card has
// nothing to put in them — and bands 3–4 are CLIPPED rather than allowed to
// wrap, so a busy card loses its surplus pills whole instead of growing.
//
// Band 3 is the one exception, added by #1139: it is reserved whenever it has
// VISIBLE content, and stamped `data-empty="1"` (and hidden by CSS) when it
// has none. The reserve bought alignment between rows that, on most apps, are
// uniformly blank — an issue card can only fill the band if somebody voted an
// attribute, claimed it, commented or opened a close vote — so what it
// actually bought was 27px of empty band on every issue card. The element is
// still EMITTED when empty, because the action band's own cap is written as
// `.dev-card-status + .gc-card-actions` and removing the node would silently
// uncap it.
//
// Three things this file guards that are easy to break later:
//   • bands 2 and 4 reserve unconditionally on the board and collapse on the
//     detail head (`dense: false`), the one caller with no neighbour to align
//     to; band 3 additionally collapses when it is visually empty;
//   • the clip heights are FIXED (min === max), because a max-only height
//     would let a band with content collapse and take the alignment with it;
//   • band 3's empty flag comes from the render INPUTS, not the emitted HTML —
//     the 💬 badge ships at count 0 wearing Tailwind's `hidden`, so the band's
//     markup is never an empty string on an issue card.
//
// Companion files: dev-card-badge-cap.test.js owns which chips make it into
// band 3, card-action-layout.test.js owns which buttons make it into band 4,
// and dev-chip-geometry.test.js owns the chip box itself.
//
// Run with: node --test tests/dev-card-band-layout.test.js
