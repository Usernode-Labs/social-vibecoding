// Install the launcher grid's view-model store into a vm sandbox.
//
// #1191 converted `#app-list` to React: `Home.render()` no longer assigns
// innerHTML, it pushes a plain view model into
// frontend/src/features/home/grid-store.ts, which features/home/app-grid.tsx
// renders. home.js reaches that store by `import`, and ./home-modules strips
// every import line so the source can run as classic script text in a vm — so
// any test that CALLS Home.render() has to supply the binding the import would
// have made, exactly as installAppCard(sandbox) already does for the shared
// card builders.
//
// This installs the REAL store rather than a spy: lib/plain-store.js is a few
// lines of dependency-free JavaScript, and running the shipped implementation
// means a test asserting on `gridStore.get()` is asserting on the same
// merge/notify semantics the browser gets — including the "a patch that
// changes nothing does not notify" rule, which is what keeps a no-op render
// from waking React.
//
// The store's own module is TypeScript, so its INITIAL value is transcribed
// here rather than parsed out of it. tests/home-grid-store-initial.test.js
// pins the two against each other, so a field added there without one here
// fails loudly instead of silently reading undefined.
//
// The home screen has TWO of these stores and `Home.render()` pushes both on
// the same pass, so both are installed here. `chromeStore` holds the two hosts
// OUTSIDE the launcher canvas — "Show all N apps" and the iOS widget strip —
// which is why it is a separate store and not another field on the grid: the
// grid model is deliberately not pushed mid-drag (see grid-store.ts), and
// those two have nothing to do with that guard.
