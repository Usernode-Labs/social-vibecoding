// were wrong with that shape, and they are the same three #1668 fixed for
// the waitlist (#1296):
//
//   - It counted SUCCESSES. A sign-in that worked burned a slot, so one
//     office NAT or carrier CGNAT got ten sign-ins per 15 minutes for
//     everyone behind it.
//   - The remedy shared the bucket with the failure: password-reset could
//     be throttled by the very login failures that made it necessary, and
//     the three-step OTP signup competed with login for the same ten.
//   - It was keyed on the address only. Nothing anywhere bounded guessing
//     against ONE account (there is no lockout table and no edge limiter),
//     so vertical brute force from rotating addresses was unbounded.
//
// So: one limiter per family, failures-only wherever the abuse being
// bounded is itself a stream of failures, and a per-identifier bucket on
// login. The mail-sending routes are the exception that still counts
// successes — a delivered email is the cost being bounded, not a failure.

// is a deliberate, spec'd decision and this does not change it; an
// idempotency key would, and belongs to whoever owns that spec. What it
// changes is that the double-award used to be UNBOUNDED.
//
// (1) PER PARTICIPANT — 60/minute. This is the one that actually bounds the
// harm the issue names. "Point inflation" means driving up ONE participant's
// score, so that is what the bucket is keyed on.
//
// It is keyed here, and not on the caller, because the caller cannot be
// identified and cannot be pinned down:
//
//   - The API KEY is not an identity. `partnerApiKey`
//     (middleware/topochain-auth.js) compares X-API-Key against ONE shared
//     secret — "v1's `api.key` middleware compared X-API-Key against one
//     shared secret with no per-client keys or scopes; v4 keeps that exact
//     comparison". Every partner presents the same string, so a key-derived
//     bucket is one global bucket: any partner's retry storm refuses all of
//     them.
//   - The ADDRESS is forgeable by this exact adversary. In Kubernetes
//     server.js passes `trustDirectPeer: true`, so services/client-ip.js
//     trusts any peer to supply a single X-Forwarded-For — its own TODO says
//     as much ("so a generated app cannot deliberately forge a single
//     forwarding header"). A partner making direct calls can therefore pick
//     its own bucket and rotate through as many as it likes.
//
// Keying on the participant survives both. An attacker who rotates the
// participant identifier to escape the bucket has stopped inflating the
// participant it was targeting, which is the goal it came for.
//
// 60/minute per participant is far above any real award pattern — activities
// are completions, not a stream — and turns "unbounded" into a rate a human
// notices before a leaderboard is meaningless.
//
// KNOWN CEILING, because it would be easy to read this as tighter than it
// is: the bucket is per (identifier_type, identifier) SPELLING, not per
// human. One person reachable as an email, a Telegram handle and a Discord
// handle is three buckets, so the real bound on that person is 3 x 60 = 180
// a minute. It is a small fixed multiplier on a previously unbounded number,
// not a bypass — but it is not the "60 per participant" the name suggests.
//
// Closing it properly needs the key to be the RESOLVED user id, and this
// limiter cannot have it: resolution is the `SELECT id FROM users WHERE
// <column> = $1` inside the route (routes/topochain/partner.js), which runs
// after this middleware. Doing it right means resolving the participant in
// its own middleware ahead of the limiter and having the handler read that
// instead of re-querying — a restructure of a handler whose comments carry
// four documented SPEC judgment calls, and not something to do incidentally
// inside a rate-limit fix. Whoever takes that on: key this on the user id,
// drop identifier_type from the key, and this note goes with it.
// The identifier types the partner route accepts, mirroring
// `IDENTIFIER_COLUMNS` in routes/topochain/partner.js (SPEC 1330-1339's
// `in:email,telegram,discord`). Two copies, because middleware importing a
// route module is the wrong direction — tests/topochain-rate-limits.test.js

// (2) PER ADDRESS — 600/minute. This one is NOT a security boundary, and
// the distinction matters enough to state rather than imply.
//
// It bounds the ACCIDENT: a partner integration whose retry loop runs away,
// which is the likeliest way this endpoint actually misbehaves and the one
// that needs no attacker at all. Against that it works, because a buggy
// client does not rotate its own forwarding header.
//
// It does NOT bound a deliberate attacker. In Kubernetes server.js passes
// `trustDirectPeer: true`, so a caller supplies its own single
// X-Forwarded-For and picks this bucket; rotating that header and the
// participant identifier together gives a fresh bucket in both limiters on
// every request. An earlier draft of this comment claimed this limiter
// capped total volume and in-memory bucket growth. It does not, and saying
// so was worse than saying nothing — it reads like a guard.
//
// So what actually holds against a deliberate attacker is limiter (1)
// alone, and only for the participant it is targeting: it cannot inflate
// any single participant past 60/minute however it presents itself, which
// is the harm #2526 names. It CAN still issue unbounded requests in total.
//
// CLOSING THAT NEEDS AN IDENTITY THIS ENDPOINT DOES NOT HAVE. Both possible
// caller keys are dead ends today: the API key is one shared secret (every
// partner sends the same string, so the bucket would be global and any
// partner's storm would refuse all of them), and the address is caller-
// supplied. The fix is per-partner API keys — already recorded as future
// work in the SPEC note quoted above — after which this limiter should key
// on the partner's identity and this comment should be replaced by one that
// can honestly call it a caller bound.
//
// 600/minute is deliberately generous for the accident it does bound: a
// partner legitimately awarding a batch of participants should never meet
// it, and a runaway loop stops at ten a second instead of as fast as the
// socket allows.

//     holds no matter where the requests come from. It sits just under the
//     mail throttle's own 5-per-day-per-recipient rule, so the ceiling a
//     determined caller actually meets is the one that bounds the sending.
//   * per IP (10 / 15 min) — the sweep: one caller walking a list of
//     addresses, each of which is under its own limit.
//
// Both are silent as far as the caller can tell: a 429 here is the standard
// limiter body, and it is reached by REQUEST COUNT, never by anything about
// whether the address is on the list. The endpoint itself answers the same
// 200 to every branch.

// exactly.
