    // planner's ESTIMATE crosses jit_above_cost, and inlines and optimizes it

    // correlated subqueries that mostly never run, so the notifications feed
    // did ~43 ms of work and spent 2.9 s compiling it (EXPLAIN ANALYZE on the
    // replica); pg_stat_statements on the primary had compiling as ~99% of
    // every compiled statement's time, 14,610 s since 9 Sep. JIT pays off for
