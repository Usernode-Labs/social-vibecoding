// What the author of a visible change is told, when they declare it, about
// the data the before & after copies hold. The largest group of changes
// that ended with no shots (7 of 24 in about 125 merged proposals) were
// declared for a state the copies did not have: a request waiting for
// approval, standings players with activities, an answered plan, an invited
// account. The shots agent found that out on the copies, after the author
// had finished, so it is said here instead, while the author can still seed
// the data or say how to make it.
//
// Every visible declaration's answer lists the ready-made states (the demo
// states of shots-demo-states.js, which only Homeroom's own copies get) and
// where anything else must come from. A WARNING is added only for a declared
// change whose own words name a state from NEEDS that no ready-made state
// holds for its persona, and whose author gave no hints.setup: the steps the
// shots agent takes through the UI on both copies are the author saying how
// it is made.
// Advisory, like shots-identities.personaWarnings: a declaration is never
// refused for it.
//
// One need is not a state but an answer: a change whose steps ask the
// Homeroom bot (or an app's own AI feature) for something and wait for its
// reply. The copies have no model key, so the bot only says it cannot reach
// its model there; since the bot's own proposals got shots (#4487), its
// changes to its own replies ended that way (PR 4536's offer to close a
// request, 2026-10-09). No step through the UI and no ready-made state makes
// a model answer, so that warning is given whatever hints.setup says and
// whichever states are ready-made.
//
// Where a missing state comes from. The answer used to send every seed to a
// change merged before this one, because a seed this proposal adds reaches
// only the after copy. Most states the copies lacked were new in the
// proposal itself, and the after copy is the only side a new state needs:
// from 2026-10-09 to 10-12, 22 shot runs failed and 13 more changes were
// skipped for want of a state, PR 4825's new bell row for a change you voted
// on and PR 4765's "Did you mean" card from the bot among them. So the answer
// says to seed a new state in the same proposal, what a seed may hold (rows
// for the shots' fixture accounts and fake people, never a signal the code
// reads to decide something; a reply as the stored message), and that only
// a change to a state that already existed needs its seed merged first.
//
// Two needs the shots agent meets itself, on both copies alike: a step that
// chooses a file (it chooses one of the sample files, shots-samples.js) and
// a loading or error state behind one API GET (it holds or fails that
// request). The note names both, so an author says which in hints.setup.
//
// Pure: the declare route reads the app once and passes `selfApp`.

const { SAMPLE_NAMES } = require('../../worker/shots-samples');

// Each demo state in a few words, with who it is for (its persona and
// alsoFor), in shots-demo-states.js's order. tests/shots-ready-states.test.js
// keeps the two lists the same.
