// #4239: moving a request about Homeroom itself to Homeroom's own board.
//
// People file problems with the platform (its header, its suggestion form, a
// project's description or invite message) on a project's board, where no
// change to the project can fix them. The triage says so (its `platform`
// flag on a person verdict, stored on the run as about_platform) and the
// DM's chat model can say so too (offer_move_request). Either way the
// requester is offered a move, decided by a tap like any offer:
//
//   Move it to Homeroom  files the request on Homeroom's board with its
//                        original title and words and a footer naming where
//                        it came from and who first asked, credited to its
//                        author; leaves a link on the original; and closes
//                        the original. Closed at once ONLY when the person
//                        tapping filed it and nobody else has taken part in
//                        it (no comments, votes, claims, kudos or
//                        proposals); otherwise the original's group votes on
//                        closing it (a close_issue proposal), so nothing
//                        somebody else is involved in closes without a vote.
//   Keep it here         leaves everything as it is.
