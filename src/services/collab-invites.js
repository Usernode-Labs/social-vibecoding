/**
 * Sending a collaborator invite: the pending `app_collaborators` row, the
 * invitee's notification pushed live, and the analytics event. Two callers
 * send one: POST /api/apps/:slug/invites (routes/collaborators.js), one at a
 * time from Members & approvals, and POST /api/apps (routes/apps.js), for the
 * people a Group is created with (communities, stage 3). One function, so an
 * invite sent at creation is the same invite, with the same notification the
 * invitee accepts or declines, as one sent from the project's page.
 *
 * A pending invite grants nothing: accepting it (routes/collaborators.js)
 * makes the row a `member`, and that is what joins the project's community
 * (the collaborator trigger in src/db/schema.sql). The pending row already
 * makes the project read as a Group (communities.audienceSql).
 *
 * ── Joining, or building ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * On a project only its people can see (a Group, or Just you becoming one)
 * this invite IS how somebody joins: being a collaborator is what being in a
 * private project is, which is why an invite link there is this same grant
 * (community-invites.js grantFor). So it is worded as an invitation to join
 * (`detail: 'join'` on its notification, `joins` on the pending invite), and
 * carries the inviter's note the way a link does. Only on a project anyone
 * can use but only its invited people build is it an invitation to build.
 * Accepting one that joined them answers with what the link path's "You're
 * in" needs (welcomeFor), so the two ways in end on the same welcome.

 * the address is claimed (services/email-invites.js turns it into this
 * pending row). Idempotent: accepting when already a member is
 * `{ ok: true, alreadyMember: true }`, for two-tab races.

 * Accepting pins the app to Home, as an invite link does
 * (apply_community_invite in src/db/schema.sql) and as Join does
 * (communities.join). The pin is not decoration: the daily vote digest
 * (services/vote-digest.js) finds people only through app_favorites and
 * the creator, and the per-proposal notification reads the same rows
 * beside the members active lately, so a member added by name without a
 * pin would not hear about a vote until they had been active.
 * `hidden = FALSE` clears an earlier opt-out, as the link path does. The
 * pin is written in the same transaction as the membership, so an accept
 * never lands without it; the already-member answer writes nothing, so a
 * second tab cannot undo a later opt-out.
 *
 * Returns `{ ok: true, appSlug }` or `{ ok: false, status, error }`; the
 * inviter's notification, the chat line and the event are best-effort.
