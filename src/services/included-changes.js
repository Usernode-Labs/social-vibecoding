// A change that went live inside another one.
//
// A change can be built on top of another open change: the Homeroom bot
// asked to "fix mark as done in Jordan's first version" built its fix on the
// first version's branch, so the fix's pull request carried the first
// version's commit as well as its own (Flat 4B Chores, 5 Oct 2026: PR 8 built
// on PR 3). When the fix merged, the first version's work went live with it,
// but nothing said so: GitHub squashes, so PR 3's own commit is not on main
// and GitHub never marked it merged. PR 3 stayed open and still asked for
// votes, its lazy window would have tried to merge it again, request #1 stayed
// open, and the App tab kept saying the first version was being built over
// the live app.
//
// So when a change merges, every other change of the app that is up for a
// vote and whose head commit is one of the merged pull request's own commits
// (GitHub's list of the commits on it, which it keeps after a squash merge)
// is INCLUDED in it. The signal is exact and costs one GitHub read per merge,
// and none when nothing else is up for a vote: a head on that list is a
// commit the merged change brought to main, so the included change has
// nothing left that is not live. A head the list does not have (a newer
// revision, a change never built on) is left alone, and a change already on
// main before the merge is never on the list, so the other order (the lower
// change merging first) includes nothing.
//
// An included change is marked merged with the merge it went live in
// (merged_at and merge_commit_sha are that merge's, so its deploy state is
// that merge's) and `included_in_session_id` names the change that carried
// it. Being merged is what every reader already understands: the vote panel,
// Needs you and the lazy window only look at changes up for a vote, a vote on
// it is refused, its requests read "approved and live", and a project's first
// version reads live (homeroom-bot-dm.js firstVersionState). Then, in the
// background, what a merge does for a change is done for it: its pull
// request is closed with a line saying where it went, its thread says so, its
// requests are closed, the bot's other work on them stops
// (homeroom-bot.js noteRequestMerged), whoever asked for it hears it is live
// (homeroom-bot-dm.js noteProposalMerged), the journey records it
// (journey-events.js recordChangeLive), and its preview and worker go.
//
// Called from the merge (routes/votes.js finalizeMerge) once the merged
// change is marked merged. Never a reason a merge fails.
