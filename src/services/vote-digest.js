/**
 * The once-a-day "what needs your vote" digest (#1374).
 *
 * ── Why this exists ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * #1374 made `new_proposals` default OFF. Before that, every promoted
 * proposal pinged everyone with the app in "Your apps", everyone active in
 * it and the creator, with no way to turn it off — which was the complaint.
 * But that ping is also how the group LEARNS there is something to vote on,
 * and voting is the mechanism the whole platform runs on, so switching it
 * off by default without a replacement would have quietly traded a noise
 * problem for a turnout problem.
 *
 * This is the replacement: one notification a day saying how many proposals
 * are waiting on you, across every app you have a stake in. It is on by
 * default, and it is the reason muting the per-proposal ping is safe.
 *
 * ── Shape ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The sweep runs HOURLY and sends to each user at most once per
 * MIN_GAP_HOURS. That is deliberately not "once a day at 09:00": the
 * platform stores no timezone for a user, so a fixed hour would be
 * breakfast for some people and the middle of the night for others.
 * Sweeping hourly and gating on "has this person had one recently" means
 * everybody gets one a day, near the time of day they first became
 * eligible, with no timezone anywhere in the code.
 *
 * The count is the open proposals waiting on a person: promoted proposals
 * in apps they have pinned or created, that they did not write, have not
 * already voted on, and are not in an app they blocked. Somebody with
 * nothing to do gets nothing, which is what keeps a daily notification
 * from becoming the noise it was meant to avoid. Who counts as having a
 * stake is spelled out on PENDING_SQL below, including what it does not
 * check.

 * Users who owe at least one vote, with the count.
 *
 * A stakeholder is one of exactly two things: someone with an
 * app_favorites row for the app, or the app's creator. Nothing else is
 * read. In particular:
 *
 *   - Active users are NOT included. The per-proposal notification
 *     (services/notifications.js) also asks the members active on the app
 *     lately; this query does not, so a member who never pinned the app
 *     gets no digest for it. That is why Join (communities.join), an
 *     invite link (apply_community_invite in src/db/schema.sql) and an
 *     accepted invite (collab-invites.acceptInvite) all write the pin.
 *   - There is NO collaborator or visibility filter. A favoriter of a
 *     collab-private app they cannot vote on is still counted.
 *   - `hidden` is not read, so a hidden opt-out row counts like a pin.
 *
 * Excluded: the proposal's own author, apps the person blocked, proposals
 * they already voted on, and anyone who had a digest in the last
 * MIN_GAP_HOURS.
 *
 * Deliberately ONE query rather than a loop: this runs over every user on
 * the platform, and per-user round trips would make an hourly sweep a
 * measurable load.
