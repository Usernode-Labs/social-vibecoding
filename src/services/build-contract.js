// The build contract: the one set of rules every on-platform coding turn that
// may change an app's code works under — a dev chat build the Mayor
// dispatches, a direct OpenRouter turn, a headless auto session, and the
// Homeroom bot.
//
// Why one copy. Until this module the platform had two, and they had drifted
// as far apart as two lists can. The dev chat's Mayor-dispatched builds still
// ran on the platform's first prompt (2026-04-25, "Initial commit: extract
// from evanshapi.ro monorepo"):
//
//   - Spend minimal time reading files. Focus on writing and editing.
//   - After all changes are made, stage everything with "git add -A" …
//   - Do NOT ask questions or request clarification. Just build it.
//
// The Homeroom bot, meanwhile, had grown the strictest rules on the platform
// from its own shadow builds (the ones pinned below and in
// tests/homeroom-bot-question-bar.test.js). Sheep countrr
// (usernode-bot/sheep-countrr-a08857#48) showed what the first list produces:
// an agent that never opened the Dockerfile answered the app's own compiled
// `/tailwind.css` with 204 to quiet a sandbox error and blanked production
// for days (#38); a save/resume feature rewired the frame loop every round
// runs on and froze it (#37); an agent unsure where its edits had gone ran
// `git checkout <another member's commit> -- …` and shipped that member's
// unmerged feature inside its own proposal (#34). Each of those maps to a
// rule here.
//
// Rules are pre-wrapped lines, joined as written, so a test can pin a rule's
// exact text and a prompt reads the same everywhere it appears.
