// (the bot tab's standing, the drawer's outcomes, a request page's track, a
// project chat card's stage, the bell's moments, ...), each from the same
// records with rules of its own, and they disagreed: one request read Decide
// on the bot tab, sat in History in the drawer and said Reading in its
// project's chat. This module decides it once:
//
//   derive(facts)        the stage of a request, from one facts row (the
//                        bot's records, read by REQUEST_FACTS_SQL: the same
//                        per-request query the bot page and the track read)
//   deriveChange(facts)  the stage of a change with no request of its own
//   placeFor(state, you) where an item goes for one viewer: Needs you, In
//                        progress, Waiting, Live, or not listed
//   bellOf(prev, next)   the moment a change of stage rings, if any
//   refresh(db, items)   derives the items again and stores each that
//                        changed (work_states), returning them
//   afterTransition      the workflow's hook: after every accepted event of
//                        a machine that moves a request or a change, in its
//                        own transaction, refresh the items it is about and
//                        push each change (`work_state`)
//
// Ten stages, the same words everywhere: reading, planning, waiting_for_you
// (always with a why), building, checking, up_for_vote, going_live, live,
// stopped (with a reason), closed. The second line (`line`) carries queue and
