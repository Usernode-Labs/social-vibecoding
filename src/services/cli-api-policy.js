// in a checkout they control, and the wrong shape for a token a third-party
// chat product (Claude.ai, ChatGPT) holds on their behalf.
//
// Connector tokens are therefore governed by an exhaustive ALLOWLIST,
// fail-closed: a route that is not listed here is refused, so adding a new
// platform endpoint can never silently widen what a connector can reach.
// Each entry is a method plus a path pattern where `:param` matches exactly
// one non-empty segment.
//
// Note what is NOT here and must not be added casually: nothing that votes,
// merges, force-merges, withdraws, changes app settings or touches
// membership. A connector may describe apps, file a request, hand work to
// the user's own coding agent and turn the result into a proposal — the
// group still decides whether it ships.
