/**
 * The ONE branded frame every send goes through (#1555, restyled for #2673).
 *
 * The report was that the mails do not look like one another. They did not:
 * the shell was a bare `<body>` with a font stack, three templates wrapped
 * themselves in it, one was wrapped by `buildMessage`, and the result had no
 * sender identity anywhere except inside the sentences.
 *
 * ── Why a logo image now, reversing the #1555 call ─────────────────────
 *
 * #1555 argued for a text wordmark instead of an `<img>`: Gmail/Outlook block
 * remote images until the reader asks, Apple Mail proxies them, and a data:
 * URI is stripped by some clients and counted against others' clipping
 * threshold. All of that is still true. #2673 asks for the logo anyway, so
 * the tradeoff is accepted deliberately rather than papered over: the `alt`
 * text below IS the wordmark fallback for a client that blocks the image, so
 * the identity still renders as type when the picture does not. The asset is
 * hosted on the platform's OWN origin (public/brand/, the same public,
 * unauthenticated tier /icons/ and /illustrations/ already use — see
 * src/middleware/auth.js), not a third party, so there is nothing here for a
 * mail client's remote-content warning to be right to warn about.
 *
 * ── Table-free, and deliberately ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The layout is one centred block with a max width. There is no grid to hold
 * together, so the usual `<table>` scaffolding buys nothing here and costs
 * every future editor a nested-markup puzzle. Inline styles only: `<style>`
 * blocks and classes are stripped by Gmail's clipper and by Outlook.
 *
 * ── Colors are the platform's own tokens, not generic defaults ─────────
 *
 * Every hex below is read off tailwind.config.js's `violet`/`zinc` scales and
 * public/css/app.css's `--accent*` custom properties — the same accent and
 * neutral ramp the app UI itself renders with, not a default blue or a
 * mail-template grey invented for this file.
 *
 * ── The footer says what this IS and why it arrived ────────────────────
 *
 * Claiming anything more would be a promise the platform does not keep: there
 * is no preference centre and no unsubscribe route for transactional mail, so
 * the footer does not offer one. It names the product, and it says these are
 * account mails rather than marketing — which is the honest answer to "why am
 * I getting this".
