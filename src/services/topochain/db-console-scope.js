// The admin SQL console's TABLE SCOPE — EVERY base table in `public`,
// minus the credential-bearing COLUMNS inside them.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: the console (`#admin/seasons/sql-console`) shipped
// scoped to `db-allowlist.js`'s 20 topochain tables, because that is what
// the topochain SPEC's D10 task asked for. The console is, in practice,
// the platform's only browse-any-table surface for an admin who is
// already looking at the admin console — and an admin who cannot see
// `apps`, `events` or `chat_sessions` from it just goes and reads them
// some other way (the unredacted `pg_dump` behind `#admin/db-export`, or
// the prod-debug SQL proxy) with strictly LESS redaction than this
// console applies. So the scope was widened to the whole `public` schema.
//
// #1130 FIXED THE HALF-WIDENING THAT LEFT BEHIND. That first widening
// borrowed BOTH of `services/debug-access.js`'s deny lists — its
// per-column one AND its per-TABLE one — so 20 tables stayed invisible
// and unqueryable, and an admin debugging push notifications got
//
//     Query references table(s) that are not available in this console:
//     mobile_push_deliveries, mobile_push_registrations.
//
// on a delivery-queue table that holds no credential at all. That
// table-level list is the right shape for the OTHER capability (see
// below); it is the wrong shape here. So the console now denies
// CREDENTIAL COLUMNS instead of whole tables: `mobile_push_deliveries`
// is fully readable, `mobile_push_registrations` is readable with
// `registration_enc`/`registration_hash` masked out, `sessions` is
// readable with `token` masked out, and so on for all 12 entries in
// `CONSOLE_CREDENTIAL_COLUMNS` below. What is BROWSABLE widens to all
// ~108 base tables; what is READABLE does not widen by one value.
//
// WHY THE TWO CAPABILITIES DELIBERATELY DIVERGE — and why this is not
// drift to be tidied up later:
//   * `usernode_debug_ro` (debug-access.js) is reached by an AUTOMATED
//     coding agent from a separate process, over a separate pool, with a
//     separate password, on production. A whole-table denial is the right
//     blast radius there: the agent has no business at all inside an
//     auth-token table, and the coarse list is cheap to audit.
//   * `topochain_console_ro` (this module) is reached by a signed-in
//     human platform admin who is already able to read the SAME rows
//     with LESS redaction two clicks away. Denying a whole table here
//     buys no confidentiality — it only pushes the admin onto a less
//     redacted path — while costing them the ability to debug.
// `DENIED_COLUMNS` is still SHARED (imported below, never restated), so
// a credential column added for one capability lands on both. Only the
// table list is console-specific. `tests/topochain-db-tools.test.js`
// asserts the divergence on purpose, so nobody "fixes" it by re-copying
// the table list.
//
// ON TOP of the shared column list, two more sources are merged in:
// `db-allowlist.js`'s `EXCLUDED_EXPORT_COLUMNS` (so the topochain
// export's own column redactions can never be narrower here than there)
// and `CONSOLE_CREDENTIAL_COLUMNS` — the per-column replacement for the
// 20 formerly-denied tables. Union semantics throughout: whichever list
// names a column, it is denied.
//
// OUT OF SCOPE, STRUCTURALLY: `credentials.user_ai_credentials`. The
// inventory query below is `table_schema = 'public'`, and that table
// lives in the separate `credentials` schema, which the console role is
// never granted USAGE on. It therefore needs no deny entry of any kind —
// it cannot appear in the scope, be granted, or be selected from.
//
// WHAT ENFORCES IT, IN ORDER OF WHO ACTUALLY DECIDES:
//   1. `db-console-role.js` — grants `topochain_console_ro` SELECT on
//      exactly the tables this module resolves, with COLUMN-LEVEL grants
//      wherever a table has denied columns. This is the security
//      boundary: Postgres itself refuses a denied column through ANY
//      access path (`SELECT *`, `row_to_json`, a cast, a comma join, a
//      function nobody has thought of yet).
//   2. `sql-console.js`'s `validateStatement` — a fast, specific 400
//      instead of a bare "permission denied" round trip. A UX layer, and
//      documented as one in that file's header.
//   3. `db-schema-info.js` — what the console's schema browser LISTS, so
//      an admin is never shown a table or column every query against it
//      then gets rejected for touching.
// All three resolve their scope from THIS module, so they cannot drift.
//
// `db-allowlist.js` is untouched and still means what it always meant:
// the scope of the topochain SQL EXPORT (a FK-ordered dump that replays
// into a fresh database). That is a deliberately different, much
// narrower thing than "which tables may an admin SELECT from", and
// widening the export was never asked for.

// the schema is like that today. Everything that used to be here is now
