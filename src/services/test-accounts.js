// Test accounts: a genuinely new account for first-time-user testing, minted

//
// Why a new account rather than "Reset first run" on an old one: a reset
// brings back the join screen and the tour but keeps memberships, votes and
// history, so Getting started shows progress a newcomer would not have. A test
// account is a REAL account — it signs in through the ordinary form (username
// and a generated password is the one method that works on the web and in the
// iOS app, against local, staging and production alike), auto-joins the
// Homeroom community and can vote — and that is exactly why it is fenced:
//
//   * users.test_account_created_at marks it, for good (schema.sql).
//   * Its votes on an app a real person made are recorded and shown but not
//     counted, and it is left out of the active-member denominator
//     (counts_toward_outcome in schema.sql; D1).
//   * Leaderboards (exclude_podium) and the Journey page (a 'test' left-out
//     entry) do not see it.
//   * No welcome DM unless the creator asked; never a season wallet on a
//     native sign-in (native-session-protocol.js; D2).
//   * At most MAX_LIVE at once, so app slots, the wallet pool and the bot's 50
//     DM places cannot be drained by a loop.
//
// The password is returned ONCE, to the admin who asked, and never logged,
// stored in plain text or written to an event or audit payload.
