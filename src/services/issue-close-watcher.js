// Post-merge issue-close watcher (#135).
//
// When a PR merges, GitHub itself closes the issues referenced via closing
// keywords (`Closes #N`, `Fixes #N`, `Resolves #N`) in the PR body — but it
// does so asynchronously, often a few seconds after the merge reports
// success. The platform's "Open Issues" panel in the group chat area busts
// its cache and refetches at merge time, which races that delay: the
// refetch can see the issue still open and re-cache it as open for the
// 5-minute fetchPublicIssues TTL, so the panel keeps showing a closed
// issue.
//
// This watcher closes the gap: it polls the referenced issues with
// retry/backoff until they read as closed (or attempts run out), and once
// closes are observed it busts the open-issues cache and broadcasts the same
// `github_synced` refresh event the merge path uses, so every group-chat
// panel refetches and drops the issue.
//
// GitHub's own keyword handling is not reliable enough to be the only path:
// on 2026-09-30 it stopped applying `Closes #N` to merged PRs for hours. So
// when the polls run out, the watcher closes the session's LINKED issues
// that are still open itself (closeLinkedIssues below) — and only those,
// and only after re-reading the PR as merged into the repo's default branch.
// Numbers that come solely from a hand-edited PR body are watched but never
// closed here.
//
// Every number it sees closed, or closes, also closes the platform's own
// `general` twin row for that request (closeTwinRows below), which nothing
// else did on a merge.

// Everything here is best-effort. watchIssuesClosedAfterMerge is
// fired-and-forgotten from the merge path (routes/votes.js checkAndMerge)
// and must never block, slow down, or roll back the merge flow — failures
// are logged and abandoned.
