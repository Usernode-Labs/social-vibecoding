// The Homeroom bot's fixed notes, said in its own voice in Homeroom.
//
// Each note the bot posts on a request is written once and sent to two
// places: a GitHub comment, which GitHub shows under the platform's app
// account, and a message in the request's (or change's) Homeroom thread,
// which Homeroom draws as the bot's own bubble. The notes were written for
// the first of the two ("Homeroom bot has a question before it can build
// this", "Homeroom bot updated this change: …"), and in Homeroom they read
// as somebody narrating the bot under the bot's own name and picture.
//
// `firstPerson` is the Homeroom copy of a note: the same words, said by the
// bot. GitHub keeps the note as written. It knows each fixed sentence the
// bot's notes are built from (homeroom-bot-live.js, homeroom-bot-followup.js,
// homeroom-bot-holds.js, homeroom-bot-dm.js FAILED_SAID.bot) and leaves
// everything else (the model's own words in a note, a reason, a question)
// alone. tests/homeroom-bot-words.test.js runs every one of those notes
// through it, so a new note that still speaks about the bot fails there.
//
// Pure.

  // A follow-up's answer needs no header: the bubble already says who.
