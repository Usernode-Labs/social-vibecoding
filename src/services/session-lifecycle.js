// withdraw: the pull request, branch, staging preview and CC volume all stay
// exactly as they are, so a later promote reuses them.
//
// Everything that decides safety happens in ONE guarded UPDATE:
//   - `status = 'promoted'` is the same compare-and-set the merge claim in
//     checkAndMerge uses ('promoted' -> 'merging'). Exactly one of the two can
//     win, so a proposal that has started merging is never pulled back, and
//     one that has been pulled back can never be claimed for a merge.
//   - `approval_epoch + 1` voids every vote cast so far, the way
//     integration.clearApprovals does (no DELETE: the rows stay as a record
//     and a re-promote shows voters "Still yes?"). recordVote locks the row
//     and requires 'promoted'/'merging', so a vote racing this either lands
//     before it (and is voided) or finds the row Underway and is refused.
//   - `active_turn IS NULL` plus the in-process busy check keep a running
//     build from being cut off mid-turn.
//   - A secret-declaration proposal is refused: its held value is discarded
//     the moment the session leaves review (services/pending-secrets.js), so
//     the author must decide to withdraw it rather than lose it silently.
//

// no worker and no paused state, so it returns to 'active', the state it was
// promoted from.

// ── Deferred branch creation (#1350) ────────────────────────────────────
//
// A native session no longer gets a git branch when it is created. Nothing
// is on the branch until an agent turn runs, and most created sessions
// never run one: the branch was an empty ref off main, plus a GitHub API
// call, minted for a session the owner might abandon on the start screen
// or hand straight over to an off-platform agent that pushes to its own
// fork. So the mint moved to the first thing that actually needs it.
//
// This helper is that mint, and it is the ONLY one on the deferred path.
// Three properties it has to have, because the callers below are a first
// chat turn, two worker-dispatch seams and the push proxy, any of which
// can be the first to arrive and two of which can arrive at once:
//
//   idempotent  - a session that already has a branch returns it untouched.
//   serialized  - SELECT ... FOR UPDATE holds the row for the whole mint,
//                 so two concurrent callers cannot mint two names for one
//                 session (the loser sees the winner's name on its read).
//   all-or-nothing - the name is persisted ONLY after GitHub has the ref.
//                 A stored branch_name whose ref does not exist is the one
//                 state the worker cannot survive: run-cc.sh dies on
//                 "branch missing upstream: origin/$BRANCH" for every
//                 build and sync turn, forever, with no way back.
//
// Off-platform venues (web-claude-code, web-codex, own-tools-pr) never run
// an on-platform turn, so they never reach any caller of this and never
// mint a branch at all. That is the second half of #1350, and it falls out
// of the deferral rather than needing its own switch.
//
// Params:
//   pool      - pg pool
//   sessionId - numeric session id
//   username  - optional; the branch's owner segment. Defaults to the
//               session owner's stored username.
//
// Returns { branchName, created }. Throws with `code` set when the session
// is gone ('no_session') or GitHub refused the ref ('branch_create_failed',
// carrying a userMessage safe to show in chat).
