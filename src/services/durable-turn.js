// A coding turn as a durable step: attach to it, or start it
// (docs/plans/bot-build-workflow.md, "Turns: attach or start").
//
// A turn is the one step of a build that goes on while nobody watches: it
// runs detached in its worker, and its journal is on the worker's volume.
// So it is kept in three moments:
//
//   1. before it is dispatched: { phase: 'started', deadlineAt, headBefore }
//   2. as its worker record is written (execInWorker `onTurnRecord`): its
//      record's identity, so a restart before the turn ends knows which
//      record on the session is this step's
//   3. once it has ended: { phase: 'done', out }; only then is the worker's
//      turn record released (worker.finishTurn), so there is no moment at
//      which a finished turn's result is in neither place.
//
// Run again (the next attempt of the work item, after a restart), the step:
//   - returns a saved result as it is, releasing the record again (which
//     does nothing if it already was);
//   - follows a record on the session that is this step's through its
//     journal to its end, settled in the ledger, its clock re-armed from the
//     saved deadline plus what the restarts cost it, a push the restart
//     caught done again from the worker;
//   - with no such record, reads the outside world before starting anything
//     again: a branch that moved past the commit the turn started from means
//     the turn landed and its record went, so its result is the branch tip
//     (the caller's `observe`); only a branch that did not move is
//     dispatched again, on what is left of its clock.
// What was saved is only ever a lower bound: no step puts the branch back
// where a checkpoint says it was.
//
// With the inert context (durable-steps.js none()), the turn is dispatched
// and timed exactly as before, and nothing is kept.
