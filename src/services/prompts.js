// Homeroom and like each other. The bot's spec for one decides the app's own

// 7 Oct 2026: and decides its finish, so the build does not invent it: what
// each repeated row or card shows and how prominently, which control each
// setting uses, how dense the main screen is, and what the populated demo
// shows. In App bench run 9 the GLM builds' populated screens looked empty
// (a ranking app's own list was six empty rows: only other people's votes
// were seeded) or hid their actions (a "view only" demo), where the builds
// that seeded the viewer's own state looked lived in. The brief's examples
// were two of the bench's own starter briefs, so they are gone: an example
// here is copied, and an example from the benchmark leaks into it.
// And its colours are no longer "an accent plus neutrals": the colours a
// subject already has were being avoided as clichés, where the designs
// people preferred used them and kept the action colour quiet (App bench
// runs 7 and 9).
// Later on 7 Oct 2026 ("V1", from running this spec prompt on Opus and
// rendering the drawn screens, which came out closer to what Opus makes
// building an app alone): a screen for reading or browsing keeps its
// actions quiet, the signature element is part of a visual language drawn

Use the platform's native UI kit for the parts it has. If the app keeps one fixed look (such as a game drawn as its own scene), say so here. The build follows this subsection and records it in the app's CLAUDE.md, so decide here rather than leaving it to the build. The "Technical implementation" half says how the demo is made: on staging and with ?demo=1 only, idempotent, either added to those responses or written once for the viewing account on its first ?demo=1 request (the platform conventions' "Staging mock data" has the rules, including keeping it out of anything the app's own logic reads). If the repository has \`design/sketch.json\`, it is the featured card its creator was shown while the app was made: an emoji (already the app's icon), a tagline and a few points that sum up the idea. Read them as context for what the app is for, never as a design: the card shows no screen, so this subsection still decides the look.`;

Open the "user" section with a screens figure that draws UP TO TWO screens of the finished first version, in full, as faithful mocks: the build takes them as its visual target. The first is normally the main screen, populated with the demo data your Design subsection describes; the second, if you draw one, is whatever best shows the app at work, such as an item opened or the main screen in the middle of its key interaction. Draw each at phone width (data-size="phone") with data-height set to the screen's real scroll length, at most 2400, and no data-focus, so the whole screen shows. A first version has no "before" worth drawing: wrap each screen's whole tree in one <div data-side="after" data-change="N">, N being that screen's item in the figure's <ol data-changes> (one item per screen, saying in plain words what it shows), and mark nothing else, so the before side stays empty rather than showing the starter's placeholder. Draw the light look; the Design subsection gives the dark look's values for the same tokens. In each screen's <style> block, define the colours as CSS custom properties named after the design kit's tokens and written as the kit writes them, "R G B" values used as rgb(var(--accent)): --ground, --surface, --raised, --fg, --muted, --line, --accent and --on-accent, plus any new token the Design subsection defines, so the build can map them one to one. Use the kit's component class names (btn-primary, btn-secondary, field, list, list-row, card, section-label) where the kit has the part.
Draw at the app's REAL fidelity: the HTML and CSS the build should write, not artwork. Every element must be something the build can reproduce with the kit's tokens, its components and plain CSS. An icon or illustration is an inline <svg> inside the screen, so the build can lift it: no emoji as icons, and no images. Icons are line icons: a 24 by 24 viewBox, one stroke width, at most about 8 shapes each, and no gradients, filters, masks, patterns or text turned into paths. A consistent set of them is welcome: one for each kind of thing, the app's own mark, its actions. A larger illustration is fine where it carries the subject, each kept to about 30 shapes. Each screen, its <style> included, stays within about ${SCREEN_BUDGET_WORDS} characters: a screen that needs more is drawn in too much detail. Draw repeated rows with identical structure. Spend the effort where a careful designer would: hierarchy, density, spacing, type and the subject's own details; leave out decoration that carries no meaning.`;

  <h1>Short title</h1>
  <p>Optional one or two sentence summary.</p>
  <section data-spec-tab="user">…</section>
  <section data-spec-tab="tech">…</section>
</article>

The "user" section is the User-facing half and the "tech" section is the Technical half; everything said about those halves applies to these sections. Inside them use plain elements only: h3, h4, p, ul, ol, li, strong, em, code, pre, a (https links only), table/thead/tbody/tr/th/td, blockquote, hr, figure, figcaption. No script, no style attribute, no ids, no images by URL. A class is kept only if it starts with "spec-". Wherever these instructions name a "### X" subsection (Questions, Design, Considerations, Deferred work, Assumptions), write it as <h3>X</h3> inside the matching section.

  <figcaption>Optional line shown under the screens</figcaption>
</figure>

Unchanged parts appear once and show on both sides. A screen that does not exist yet (a first version, a new page) shows what is there today, or an empty state, on the before side, and the new screen is data-side="after".
- data-focus="x y w h", in the screen's pixels, frames the close-up the viewer opens on: the part that changes plus enough around it to recognise the place. Draw only as much of the screen as that close-up and its surroundings need. data-persona says who is signed in (member, guest, read_only_admin, full_admin); member is the default.

SVG may use svg, g, path, rect, circle, ellipse, line, polyline, polygon, text, tspan, title and desc with presentation attributes (no ids, markers, gradients or style). Draw with these classes so it reads in light and dark mode: spec-box, spec-box-changed, spec-box-new (dashed, for new code), spec-line, spec-arrow (a small polygon arrowhead), spec-muted, spec-accent, spec-good, spec-bad.

// ── What the launchpad hands to the agent (#1049 successor) ───────────
//
// The browser used to mint the work order: the user typed a brief into the
// walkthrough, Homeroom minted a task and rendered a ~300-line order, and two
// more steps walked them through copying it and coming back to press Submit.
// That is backwards — people expect to talk to Claude Code or Codex, not to
// fill in a form on Homeroom first — and it is also the reason the launchpad
// had any state to get stuck on.
//
// So this is all it hands over now. The agent asks what to build, then calls
// prepare_work ITSELF, which is what returns the task id, the branch and the
// base commit. Two things fall out of that and are worth keeping in mind
// before shortening this further:
//
//   The connector is REQUIRED, not advisory. Without it there is no
//   prepare_work, so no base commit and no task id, and the last paragraph is
//   the only thing standing between that agent and a branch cut from the
//   wrong place. The walkthrough refuses to render this step at all until the
//   account has one.
//
//   The base commit is fresher this way. A work order minted in the browser
//   pinned whatever main was when the user pressed a button; pasted three
//   days later it branched from stale code. prepare_work called at the moment
//   work actually starts cannot.
//
// Step 0 (#2092) comes before the question. A session is routinely dispatched
// into a checkout it did not make — a fork whose main is far behind the app's

// checkout says so, because `git fetch origin` compares a fork with itself. An
// agent that asks what to build and then reads THAT code plans the change
// against a version that no longer exists. So before it reads or asks anything
// it verifies the checkout through get_checkout_status and moves to the commit
// the canonical main is at. That moves the working copy only: the commit a
// proposal starts from is still the one prepare_work returns, never a merge of

// said what they want there, so asking again would make them repeat a whole
// conversation. The spec is the user's own writing, drafted by the Mayor, so
// it travels as data inside an <untrusted-content> envelope and is clipped to
// SPEC_HANDOFF_MAX_CHARS, well under prepare_work's brief budget. Without a
// spec the text is exactly what it was, byte for byte: the dev chat's own
// walkthrough never passes one.
