// The platform's ONE username-directory implementation (issue #1195).
//
// Three surfaces read it and must never drift apart:
//   • GET /api/app-platform/users/{lookup,search}  — app containers
//     (src/routes/app-platform-api.js), app token + user token.
//   • GET /api/app-directory/users/{lookup,search} — the shell's bridge
//     relay (src/routes/app-directory.js), browser session.
//   • GET /api/users/search                        — the platform's own
//     collaborator/app-admin invite typeahead (src/routes/collaborators.js).
//
// Plus one list that is not a search: GET /api/app-platform/members, the
// calling app's own people (listAppMembers below). All four leave out the
// same platform accounts (HIDDEN_USERNAMES and synthetic users).
//
// One matching rule, one escaping rule, one ordering rule, and — the
// point of the exercise — ONE projection. A directory answer is
// `{ id, username }` and nothing else: no display_name, bio, avatar,
// email, usernode_pubkey, locale, is_admin, created_at or profile_*
// column may ever join this SELECT list. `username` is the canonical route
// key and is already public; everything else on the users row is either
// private or gated behind the opt-in public-profile allowlist in
// src/routes/profiles.js. It stopped being IMMUTABLE when username changes landed — lookupExact
// resolves retired handles through src/services/usernames.js, and always
// answers with the current one.

// users.username is VARCHAR(255) — anything longer cannot match a row,
// so it is a bad request rather than a miss.

//     check, so it opens every preview; a 4 October 2026 first-session run
//     found its handle on a group's chore rota, "next: usernode-capture-admin".
//     `staging-demo-user` is in that set too but is left out of this one: it
//     exists only in a staging clone, whose user-directory fixtures
//     (migrate.js seedStagingUserDirectory) are `staging-demo-*` handles a
//     preview is meant to find.
