// A promoted proposal stuck on a check that MAIN failed, after main has been
// fixed.
//
// A preview builds the proposal's own code, fixtures and seeds included, so
// a check broken on main fails on every proposal whose branch has main's
// broken copy, and a fix landing on main changes none of their verdicts.
// On 9 Oct 2026 the Custom domain check (#4405) failed on every proposal
// because its staging fixture made the wrong account the project's manager.
// The fix (#4576) merged, and about fifteen proposals, several of them
// approved, stayed red on it: a re-run builds the same branch, and the
// "Sync with main" that would have fixed each is its owner's button, which
// nobody presses on the Homeroom bot's. They waited until somebody noticed.
//
// The merge queue does not bring a clean proposal up to date, on purpose
// (services/merge-queue.js): a proposal is judged on its own head, and a
// sync plus a full re-run per open proposal per merge is the herd #2100
// removed. services/boot-failure-sync.js is the first exception, for a
// preview that will not start because main moved. This is the second, and
// it is as narrow:
//
//   - the proposal is promoted, the platform's to push to (not imported),
//     and its checks settled 'failing' on its current head;
//   - every check that blocks it, the unit-suite row aside, passed on the
//     last merged proposal that ran it (main passes it now), and fails on at
//     least MIN_FAILING open proposals (so it is main's failure, not this
//     change's). The unit-suite row is one row for thousands of tests, so it
//     says nothing about which; a failure in it neither counts as fixed nor
//     stops the sync, whose new run re-tests it on a head containing main;
//   - it is behind main and merges with it cleanly (services/integration.js);
//   - at most once per head, and at most once per check: a check it was
//     synced for that still fails once it contains main is its own failure
//     (fixed_check_sync_keys), and waits for a person.
//
// A clean sync is a mechanical merge, so the approval epoch does not move
// and the votes the proposal has keep counting (services/pr-vote-revision.js).
//
// It runs as a leader-only sweep every INTERVAL_MS, rather than from each
// path a merge can take, so a proposal that was stuck before it existed is
// found on its first pass.
