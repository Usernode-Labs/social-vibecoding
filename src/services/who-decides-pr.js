/**
 * #4666: WHO CAN SEE & CHANGE IT, proposed as one change.
 *
 * The sheet of that name (frontend/src/features/dialogs/who-decides.tsx)
 * puts who can see a project and how its changes are approved in one place,
 * and whatever is changed there goes up as ONE pull request on dapp.json:
 * the `visibility` block, the `governance` block, or both. Same lifecycle as
 * a visibility or a governance change (services/rename-pr.js
 * createManifestPR): the PR drops into the vote panel, and when it merges
 * the production rebuild's reconciles apply it.
 *
 *   visibility   'private' (a private community: members see and build it)
 *                or 'public' (a public community: anyone can see and join
 *                it, and everyone who can see it can suggest changes).
 *                "Public, invite-only building" is not offered any more; a
 *                project that has it keeps it until it proposes one of the
 *                two, and its sheet says what it has.
 *   governance   `{ preset }` or `{ groups, rules }`
 *                (services/governance-rules.js), written as dapp.json's
 *                `governance` block, which replaces the old two keys.
 *
 * A change to who decides is always flagged for explicit approval, so it is
 * decided by the creator's yes or the group's real votes, never on a quiet
 * wait (services/governance.js computeRulesGate; on a project still on the
 * old two columns, the #788 modifier as before).
 *
 * The route (POST /api/apps/:slug/who-decides-pr) owns the gates. This
 * module owns reading the body (pure: parseChange, describeChange) and the
 * edit.
