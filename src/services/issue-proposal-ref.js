// proposal's page already draws (#2431).
//
// A closed issue said nothing about what closed it, and an issue being
// worked on said nothing about the change in flight. Both links already
// exist in `chat_sessions`: `linked_issues` (the Mayor's addresses_issues,
// which also writes the PR body's "Closes #N") and
// `created_from_issue_number` (the issue a session was started from). So
// this resolves them rather than reading GitHub's timeline — no extra API
// call, and it answers for work that has not merged yet, which the timeline
// cannot.
//
// ONE query for a whole list of numbers. The issues list route calls it with
// every number on the board and the single-issue route with one, so neither
// pays per card.
//
// What it does NOT do: decide the wording. A merged proposal on a CLOSED
// issue reads "Closed by"; the same row on an issue still open reads
// "Addressed by", and only the caller knows the issue's state. The `state`
// here names the PROPOSAL's lifecycle and stops there.
