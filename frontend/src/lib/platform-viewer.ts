/**
 * Is there a viewer the platform's member APIs will answer? (QA 2026-09-24 Q35)
 *
 * The shell is one document for everybody, so every store in it is mounted on
 * the signed-out landing and in the waiting room too. A store that fetched a
 * member-only endpoint at mount (`/api/models`, `/api/agent-sessions`,
 * `/api/global-chat/bootstrap`) therefore asked on every anonymous page and
 * got a 401, and asked from the waiting room and got a 403. Each refusal is a
 * red "Failed to load resource" line in the console: four on every
 * signed-out screen, and a console error on a route fails proposal checks.
 *
 * The answer is the shell's own: `window.App.user` is set once the session is
 * known, and `hasPlatformAccess === false` is the waiting room (public/js/
 * app.js gates on exactly that, `=== false` so an older cached user without
 * the field is not locked out).
 *
 * A store that asks too early (the React tree mounts before App.init has read
 * /api/auth/me) is not refused for good: `whenPlatformViewer` runs it again
 * on `sv:authed`, which the authed boot dispatches on `document` once per
 * document and only for a released account, including a reload-free sign-in
 * and a waiting-room release. Same shape as the notifications bell and the
 * messages store, which already waited for it.
