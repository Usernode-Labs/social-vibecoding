 * scrolling underneath it (a row arriving, focus moving into the menu) shut
 * the menu while the button it hangs from had not moved a pixel. A scroll
 * inside the panel itself never closes it.

 * Escape hands focus back to the anchor when it was inside the panel, so a
 * keyboard user is not dropped at the top of the document.
 *
 * The click listener is on the CAPTURE phase so a click that something else
 * stops still closes the panel. `close` is read through a ref: the effect
 * binds once per opening, and the caller's function may change identity on
