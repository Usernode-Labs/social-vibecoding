/**
 * THE KEYBOARD IS UP IN THE HOMEROOM APP TOO (first-session run, 4 Oct 2026).
 *
 * In the iOS app, Messages with the on-screen keyboard open drew the Resume
 * strip and the tab bar ON the keyboard, over the bottom of the composer, half
 * covering Send. Mobile Safari never shows that: there the kit's tracker
 * (usernode-native/v1/native.js) sees the keys cover the page, sets
 * `html.un-kb`, and app.css takes the bar and the strip away
 * (`html.un-kb #platform-tabs`, `html.un-kb #platform-parked`).
 *
 * The app gets there differently. It is a Flutter shell around a WKWebView,
 * and the Scaffold that holds the web view resizes it to end at the keyboard
 * (Flutter's default `resizeToAvoidBottomInset`; flutter-mobile-app,
 * lib/features/dapps/dapp_webview_screen.dart). So the PAGE gets shorter and
 * nothing covers it: the layout viewport and the visual viewport shrink
 * together, the kit's `layout - visualViewport.height` stays 0, and `un-kb`
 * never comes on. The bar, fixed to the foot of a page that now ends at the
 * keys, sits on them, and every screen still reserves its band. The Android
 * app's web view is resized the same way.
 *
 * So this asks the question in the page's own terms: is a field that raises
 * the keyboard focused, AND is the visible page shorter than it is at rest by
 * more than any toolbar could account for? That is the keyboard however the
 * host made room for it: covered (Safari, Chrome; the visual viewport shrinks)
 * or resized (the app's web view; everything shrinks). It publishes the answer
 * as `platform-kb-open` on <html>, on a phone layout only, and app.css hides
 * the bar and the strip on it and drops the band they reserve, so the composer
 * sits directly on the keyboard, the usual iOS arrangement. They come back
 * when it closes.
 *
 * ── Shorter than at REST, not shorter than the screen ────────────────
 *
 * "At rest" is the tallest the visible page has been at this width. Safari's
 * toolbar grows and shrinks the page by well under 150px; a phone's keyboard
 * takes more than 200. A width change (rotation) starts the measure again.
 * A focused field with the page NOT shorter is not the keyboard either: a
 * field focused from code gets no keyboard on iOS until it is tapped, and a
 * hardware keyboard raises only a slim bar, and in both the tab bar stays.
 *
 * ── Off the moment the field lets go ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * On a blur that takes focus nowhere a keyboard can live, the class comes off
 * IN the event, as the kit clears its inset (native.js `onFocusOut`): the
 * keys start down at once, and the bar should come back with them rather
 * than when the host finally reports the taller page. A hop from one field
 * to another keeps the keyboard, so `relatedTarget` decides.
 *
 * ── Except under a finger: then it waits for the click ───────────────
 *
 * Production run, 5 Oct 2026, the iOS app, a project's Discussion: with the
 * keyboard up, a tap on the group chat's Send closed the keyboard and sent
 * nothing. The tap's mousedown blurred the field, the class came off in that
 * blur, the bar and the strip came back, and the composer fell by the
 * keyboard's height before the click was dispatched, so the click landed on
 * nothing. Every composer's Send now keeps the field focused through the
 * press (`onMouseDown` prevents the default, as Messages' always did), and
 * so do the sign-in sheet's step buttons and links (`KEEP_FIELD` in
 * features/auth/sign-in-sheet.tsx), whose panel is capped to the visible
 * band and would have moved out from under the finger before the click
 * (#4214). This is the net under every other button pressed with the
 * keyboard up: a blur during a press (a touch or pointer down in the last
 * PRESS_WINDOW_MS, counting its release, that has not yet ended in a click
 * or a cancel) leaves the class on until that click has been dispatched, or
 * CLICK_WAIT_MS at the most, and then reads the page again, so focus that
 * moved to another field keeps it. The keyboard's Done (the ✓ above the
 * keys) is no press in the page, and a tap on empty space ends in its click
 * in the same moment, so the bars still come back with the keys there.
 *
 * The hold covers this module's class and cover only. The kit's `un-kb`, and
 * the `--platform-vv-top` that follows it, still change in the blur itself,
 * so a surface that reads them (`.platform-kb-sheet`'s max-height cap in
 * app.css) needs the press to keep the field focused rather than the hold.
 *
 * Whether a focused element can be holding the keyboard is the kit's own
 * classifier (`unNative.physics.keyboardCanBeUp`), read at call time, so
 * this and `un-kb` never disagree about what a text field is.
 *
 * ── And where the visible page is, while it is open ──────────────────
 *
 * iPhone 17 simulator, iOS 26 Safari, 5 Oct 2026: the sign-in sheet's
 * password step had its Sign in button behind the keys and its password
 * field half under the keyboard's floating bar; the first session's make
 * screen had "Make it" under that bar. Both are full-screen `fixed` surfaces,
 * which Safari leaves at the full height of the page with the keys over
 * their foot, and which iOS PANS up (the visual viewport's offsetTop) to
 * reveal a tapped field, wordmark and all. The kit's `--un-kb-inset` is the
 * cover alone, and its pan reset (attachKeyboardAvoidance's settled pin)
 * only runs in a bounded shell, which a phone browser's paged document
 * (#1518) is not.
 *
 * So while the class is on this also publishes the foot of the band of the
 * layout viewport the reader can actually see: `--platform-kb-cover`, how
 * much of the layout viewport is out of sight below the visual viewport (the
 * keys, and in Safari 26 the address pill and the form bar floating over
 * them: the visual viewport ends above all three). Its head is the pan,
 * which ./visual-viewport.ts already publishes as `--platform-vv-top`. A
 * surface that pads itself by the two (`.platform-kb-surface`,
 * `.platform-kb-sheet` in app.css) sits exactly in the band however the host
 * made room: covered (Safari; Chrome on Android), panned or not, or resized
 * (the app's web view, where both are 0). Written in the viewport's own
 * events, with the class, and 0px the moment the class comes off.
