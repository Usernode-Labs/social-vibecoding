/**
 * The presentation half every platform SHEET shares.
 *
 * Three surfaces present the same way — the app-context sheet behind the
 * header's title tab, Notifications and Messages behind their header glyphs —
 * and they were going to be three copies of the same forty lines. This is
 * that shape, extracted at the third caller: open/close/toggle, the kit sheet
 * adoption on touch with a CSS-slide fallback on desktop, the
 * dismiss-completion promise, and dismissal before a navigation.
 *
 * ── The publish-then-present order is load-bearing ─────────────────────
 *
 * `open()` publishes `open: true` and only THEN hands the element to the kit,
 * because the kit sheet measures the content's height ONCE at present time to
 * seed its slide-up spring. Every caller therefore has to install
 * `store.setFlush(flushSync)` in its mount module, or the publish is still
 * queued when the measurement happens and the sheet springs from nothing.
 *
 * ── One surface at a time ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every controller built here registers itself, and opening one closes the
 * hamburger drawer, the Improve panel and every OTHER registered sheet. The
 * app-context sheet used to do the first two by hand and knew nothing about
 * sheets that did not exist yet; a registry means the third and fourth
 * surface get the courtesy for free, and cannot forget to pay it.
 *
 * ── What it deliberately does NOT own ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Routing. A sheet is not a screen: it presents OVER whatever is on screen
 * and dismisses back to it, which is the whole reason Messages and
 * Notifications stopped being screen roots — a full screen needs a back
 * button, and a back button needs to know where it came from. Callers that
 * still answer a deep link (`#notifications`, `#messages/<id>`) resolve it to
 * a real screen first and then open the sheet over it.
 *
 * ── The back button closes it (QA 2026-09-24 Q16) ─────────────────────
 *
 * The dialogs already answered Back by closing (features/dialogs/use-dialog.ts
 * through lib/back-stack.ts); the sheets did not, so Back walked the history
 * UNDER an open sheet: the bell's sheet stayed up while Discover turned into
 * Home, and the Homeroom menu closed and took the page with it. A sheet claims
 * the next press the same way a dialog does, for as long as it is open.
 *
 * Every close hands the claim back as a NAVIGATING release, because most
 * closes here are the first half of a navigation (a row, a link, "All
 * messages"), written in the same task. lib/back-stack.ts explains why the
 * record then waits a task before it is spent.

 * Exported because the Improve panel needs it and is not built here: it has
 * its own controller (features/improve/improve-controller.js), so the
 * courtesy the registry pays automatically between sheets has to be asked
 * for by name in one direction.
 *
 * That asymmetry used to cost nothing, because the backdrop covered the
 * header: with a panel open there was no way to press another header control
 * in the first place, so nothing could stack. The backdrop starts below the
 * bar now, which makes the bar live and turns "Improve does not close the
 * others" from unreachable into one click away.
