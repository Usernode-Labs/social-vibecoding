/**
 * THE STAR RIDES THE PAGE; THE WASHES DO NOT.
 *
 * The home wallpaper (see "The home ground" in public/css/app.css) is the
 * body's background, and the body never scrolls — each screen root is its
 * own scroller — so every layer of it is pinned to the viewport. That is
 * right for the washes, which are ambient, and wrong for the star, which
 * the design places on the PAGE: it should slide away under the bar with
 * the tiles and come back when the page does.
 *
 * Moving the star into the scrollers would put it below the bar, since a
 * scroller starts where the bar ends and clips its overflow, and the bar
 * band is exactly where the design puts it (behind the bell, cropped by
 * the top edge). So the star stays a wallpaper layer and follows the
 * visible screen's scroll offset instead: its vertical position in the
 * shorthand is `var(--home-star-y, 0px)`, and this module writes that
 * property on <html> from the scroller that is showing. The write happens
 * inside the scroll event itself (not deferred to a frame), so the star
 * paints with the content that moved it; rAF is used only when the visible
 * screen changes, where the DOM has not settled yet.
 *
 * "At rest" is not scrollTop 0 on the launcher: Home._searchReveal parks
 * its scroller at the pulled-down search bar's height, so the offset is
 * measured from there — pulling the bar into view moves the star down with
 * the rest of the page, as it should.
 *
 * The app view has no scroller of its own (the app scrolls inside its
 * frame), so in an app the star sits at rest; the same for any route that
 * paints no wallpaper, where the property is simply unread.
