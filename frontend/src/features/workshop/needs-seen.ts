/**
 * THE VOTES YOU HAVE ALREADY PASSED OVER (#3526).
 *
 * Every badge that says how many votes wait on you (a project's Needs you
 * tab, its hub card, the Communities tab and its switcher, the Communities
 * list's rows and its Needs you row, the app menu's Workshop row) counted
 * every vote owed, whether or not you had looked at it. So a feed you had
 * swiped all the way through still said 12, and the only way to quiet the
 * number was to vote on everything, which is not what the number is for: it
 * says what is NEW for you, the way an unread count does.
 *
 * A vote you swipe past without answering is SEEN now: this device remembers
 * it, and every one of those counts leaves it out. It stays in the feed, in
 * its place, and can still be voted on; nothing is sent anywhere and nothing
 * about the vote changes.
 *
 * ── What one entry names ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A vote by its kind and id (`proposal:12`, `governance:4`) and, for a
 * change, the APPROVAL EPOCH it was seen at (`proposal:12@3`). The epoch
 * moves when somebody writes bytes nobody approved (#2038), which is when the
 * server stops counting earlier votes on it too, so a change that moved
 * under you counts again, and so does anything new. Where one side of a
 * comparison has no epoch (a row that was built without one) the id alone
 * decides, rather than a seen change counting twice over a missing number.
 *
 * ── Where the counts come from ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A project's page has its queue, so it knows which votes it is counting.
 * The server's per-project numbers (GET /api/workshop/counts) say which as
 * well since this: each project's `owed` lists the same keys, and
 * `unseenNeeds` takes the seen ones off its `needs`. A count with no list
 * (an older server, a ?demo=1 row without one) is left whole: a number this
 * cannot check is never lowered on a guess.
 *
 * ── The record ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * localStorage, per device and per account (`needsSeen:v1:<user id>`), read
 * after the first paint and wrapped like every other reading position here
 * (`workshopSeen`, `sinceSummaryDismissed`): private mode or a full quota is
 * a count that is not lowered, never an error. Bounded by age and size, and
 * never pruned against a count: an entry nothing owes any more matches
 * nothing, so it cannot take anything off. Following you to another device
 * would need a table of its own; that is a later step.
