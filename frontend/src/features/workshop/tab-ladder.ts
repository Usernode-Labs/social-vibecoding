/**
 * The Communities tab pressed while it is lit: up a level, at every width
 * (#3701). Held on a phone's bar: "Your communities".
 *
 * ── One gesture had two meanings ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Since the tab became a community (#852) the same press did two things by
 * window width: on a phone the lit tab opened the switcher, and on the
 * desktop rail the lit row went back to All communities. The phone's half
 * also broke what the tab you are already on does everywhere else, in
 * Apple's own apps and most large ones: it takes you back to the tab's first
 * page, or to the top when you are on it. Someone deep in All items or a card
 * who pressed it wanted the community back, and was shown a picker.
 *
 * ── The ladder ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * So a press of the lit tab is one step up, the same at every width
 * (`rungFor`):
 *
 *   1. BELOW A COMMUNITY'S TABS (All items, a card, a reply thread beside
 *      its Discussion): back to the community, on the tab you were on, at
 *      its top. 'up'. #4417: the tabs are places now, and every place but
 *      the Hub is below it: a channel, Needs you or the Workshop goes up to
 *      the Hub, and a page under a place (All items) to that place first.
 *   2. ON ONE OF ITS TABS, SCROLLED DOWN: to the top. 'top'
 *   3. ON ONE OF ITS TABS, AT THE TOP: All communities, the tab's root. 'root'
 *   4. ON ALL COMMUNITIES: to the top, and nothing else. 'top', or 'none'
 *      when it is already there.
 *
 * A STEP THAT CHANGES PAGE PUSHES AN ENTRY, as a tab press does (#3620), so
 * Back from where it landed is where it was pressed: a card goes up by the
 * hub's own address (`upToCommunity`), All items by the page's own tab entry
 * (AppView._pushWorkshopTab, in ../dev-board/workshop/workshop.tsx), and the
 * root by `#communities` (./community-scope.ts goToCommunity). Closing a reply
 * thread changes no page and no address, as opening it did not.
 *
 * ── Switching sideways ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The switcher is no harder to reach. The header's name and ⌄ open it as
 * they did (../header/header-title.tsx), and on a phone's bar a press HELD
 * for HOLD_MS without moving opens it too (`createHold`), the way Instagram
 * and Threads switch accounts from their profile tab. A short press never
 * does. No haptic goes with it: the native bridge has no haptic call
 * (NATIVE-BRIDGE.md), and the kit's tick is private to the kit.
 *
 * ── Who knows where you are ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The router knows the screen and the app (`App.currentApp`, and whether the
 * address is the project page itself, AppView._onProjectPage). Only the page
 * knows whether All items is up (../dev-board/workshop/workshop.tsx) or a
 * reply thread is open beside its Discussion
 * (../dev-board/workshop/project-discussion.tsx). Each tells this module
 * while it is mounted (`registerLevel`), and a press asks at that moment.
 * Nothing here renders.

 *   - the click the lift may still send. "Your communities" is over the bar
 *     by then, so that click can be hit-tested onto the sheet's scrim (which
 *     would shut it again) or reach the tab (which would take a ladder step).
