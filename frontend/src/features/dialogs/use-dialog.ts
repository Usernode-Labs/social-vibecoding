/**
 * Shared scaffolding for the nine shell dialogs (#1078 chunk I).
 *
 * Every one of them has the same lifecycle — open, populate, submit, dismiss —
 * and until this chunk that lifecycle was spread across three places: the
 * `hidden` toggle in `public/js/**`, the backdrop-click handler in
 * `App.bindEvents`, and the kit lift in `PlatformUI.adoptStaticModal`. This
 * hook is those three, merged, with React state as the single owner.
 *
 * ── The contract each dialog island signs ─────────────────────────────
 *
 *   * `rootRef` goes on the modal root. React renders that node's className
 *     ONCE (it is a constant string) and never again, because the kit writes
 *     `platform-modal-adopted` to it; `useStaticModal` mutates `hidden`
 *     through `classList` instead.
 *   * `open()` / `close()` are the only ways the dialog's visibility changes.
 *     They are published on `window.UsernodeReact.dialogs.<name>` so the
 *     legacy modules can still drive the dialog by name.
 *   * `backdropProps` goes on the root. It reproduces the dismiss rule every
 *     `bindEvents` handler spelled out by hand: a click on the root itself or
 *     on `[data-modal-backdrop]` closes, and a click that arrives inside the
 *     opening gesture's ghost-click window does not.

   * `adoptStaticModal`'s observer turned that into a dismiss + re-present;
   * this is the same round trip with React in the loop.
   *
   * Resolves once the dialog is actually OFF SCREEN (#2346). Hiding is not
   * instant: the kit plays its exit animation over the card and only removes
   * it at the end, so a caller that photographs the page the moment this
   * returns photographs the dialog fading out. Resolves at once when there
   * was nothing presented to animate, and early on `resume()`, `open()` or
   * unmount — a caller never waits on an exit that is not coming. Callers
   * that only want the dialog hidden can ignore it, as before.
