// Profile screen — the mobile app's native Profile screen absorbed into SV
// (profile-and-settings-to-web migration, NATIVE-BRIDGE.md), extended into
// an EDITABLE profile by issue #982, and reshaped into the navigation
// prototype's Me page: the identity card (picture / display name / bio /
// verified links), three stat cards (merged, kudos, challenges), a "More"
// list and "Your contributions". The rank, points, token allocation and
// per-event breakdown it used to lead with are the Challenges tab's standing
// card now (features/leaderboard/my-standing.js); see ./profile-store.js's
// header for where every other piece went.
//
// ── The three numbers are ONE read ────────────────────────────────────
//
// GET /api/me/summary (src/routes/profile.js) adds up the three subsystems
// the stat cards come from — merged proposals, kudos received, challenges
// done — and returns the newest merged proposals with them. The completed
// COUNT it returns uses the same per-user done rule as
// GET /api/me/challenges/completed, whose history is below.
//
// It deliberately does NOT list completed challenges (#981). It used to,
// from /challenges-api/challenges?season_id=…, and that section was wrong
// on two counts: `challenges.completed` is an ORGANISER flag about the
// challenge ("this one is over"), not "you finished it", so every user saw
// the same list — and season-scoped it ran to ~32 cards, burying the rank,
// token and breakdown blocks this screen actually exists for. That list now
// lives on the Leaderboard screen's Challenges tab, grouped and counted
// per event (features/leaderboard/topochain-challenges.js), which is where the
// rest of the challenge UI already was.
//
// Identity comes from the platform session: since the topochain merge,
// leaderboard participants ARE platform users, so the /me/* routes scope
// to the signed-in session server-side. Native publishes no profile identity.
//
// THE COMPLETED LIST IS THE VIEWER'S OWN. It used to filter the season's
// challenge grid on `c.completed`, which is an ORGANISER flag about the
// challenge ("this one is over") — so every signed-in person saw 28 of
// production's 34 live challenges listed as their own completions, whether
// or not they had ever earned a point. The list now comes from
// GET /api/me/challenges/completed (src/routes/profile.js), which applies
// the same per-user done rule the home Challenges widget uses.
//
// The USERNAME is deliberately not editable here (or anywhere): it is the
// sign-in identifier, the address of the public builder page, and is
// denormalized into apps.admin_usernames from repo dapp.json files. The
// display name is the supported way to change how your name appears.
//
// ── What this file is, after #1191 slice 6 ─────────────────────────────
//
// This module used to BUILD the screen, with createElement and textContent,
// into an unmanaged #profile-root. It no longer touches the DOM at all.
// Conversion 1 of slice 6 made #profile-root React-owned end to end, which the
// island rule requires before the region may hold state: the markup is now
// ./profile-view.tsx, the shaping that decides what that markup says is
// ./profile-store.js, and what is left here is the part that was never about
// the DOM — the fetches, the load-token discipline, the avatar downscale, the
// save order, and the `window.Profile` publication every legacy caller reaches
// this screen through.
//
// `_render()` kept its name and its callers; it is now a store push. Anything
// that called it to repaint after a write still works, and now repaints through
// React instead of rebuilding the subtree.
