/**
 * Copy link, in the made screen's invite sheet (./made.tsx InviteSheet):
 * the note and the link on the clipboard, the first press included, when the
 * link is still being made.
 *
 * Safari copies only while it is handling the press itself. The sheet makes
 * its link on the first press (POST /api/apps/:slug/invite-links), and a
 * press that has waited on that request is no longer one Safari will copy
 * for: `writeText` after it is refused (#4180). So a link still on its way
 * goes on the clipboard from inside the press, as a promise:
 * `clipboard.write` with a `ClipboardItem` whose text arrives later, and the
 * browser holds the write open until it does (the way Safari asks for it).
 * A link already made is written at once. Without ClipboardItem, or when that
 * write is refused, the text is copied once it is here, by `writeText` and
 * then the hidden textarea (../message-actions/clipboard.ts legacyCopy),
 * which other browsers still allow that soon after a press.
 *
 * The link is never made early to have it ready. Making one is the invite
 * going out as far as anything counts it: the `invite_link_created` event,
 * and the admin Journey's first-session "invited", which is the maker's first
 * link for the project (services/journey.js). Opening the sheet and closing
 * it again sends nothing, so it makes nothing.
