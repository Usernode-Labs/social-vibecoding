/**
 * The first-session tours' steps: real screens, each card pointing at one
 * place (./index.tsx draws them). One short title and one short sentence per
 * card: the card names the place, the screen behind it says the rest (#4044).
 *
 * Two tours, both on Home, and neither takes anybody anywhere while it runs:
 * every card rings its place and leads on with Next. The maker's walk, done,
 * then opens its project's hub (./index.tsx walkDoneLanding).
 *
 *   walk   "1, 2, 3 on Home" (Evan, 15 Oct 2026, the onboarding canvas's
 *          "A tip in the app, then 1, 2, 3 on Home"). A newcomer's first
 *          session hands them their app first, full screen, with one tip
 *          under the Homeroom mark (./app-tip.tsx). The first time Home
 *          shows after that, three cards about their own project: its
 *          tile, Homeroom bot in Messages (with a change they could ask for
 *          in it, when its starter has one), and Communities, where its hub
 *          is (homeWalkSteps). An invited private member gets the same
 *          three: no waitlist card, which they find on Home for themselves
 *          (Evan, 20 Oct 2026).
 *   look   "Look around first" (decision E, #4072): four cards on Home,
 *          where to start a project later and what the tab bar's places are
 *          (lookAroundSteps).
 *
 * The walk replaced three longer tours that walked through the app, its
 * Homeroom menu, ✕, the hub and (for an invited person) #general, pressing
 * each control in turn. The tip says what the menu is for, in the app, and
 * the walk says where everything else is, on Home.
 *
 * Every target is the product's own control or region, found by the
 * selectors the rest of the shell already pins (tests/baselines/
 * shell-markup.json, dapp.json): nothing here draws a picture of the product.
 *
 * The words are read from the catalog (frontend/locales/en/onboarding.json)
 * when a tour's steps are built, never at module load, so they are in the
 * language on screen; ./index.tsx builds them again when it changes.
