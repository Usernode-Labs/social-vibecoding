/**
 * The first session's screens: "What do you want to make?", the made screen,

 *
 *   make     ./make.tsx, "What do you want to make?". Make it makes the
 *            project; "Look around first" goes Home, to its own four cards.
 *   made     ./made.tsx, the project made, its first invite, and the way on:
 *            "Invite people later", or "Go to app" once an invite is out.
 *            A project that runs (ready-made, or a first version that is
 *            live) opens full screen; one Homeroom bot is still building
 *            goes to Home, the newcomer's first visit to Homeroom, and the
 *            walk runs there.
 *   tip      ./app-tip.tsx: the first time they open the app after the
 *            hand-off, one tip under the Homeroom mark (./first-visit.ts
 *            says when it is due).
 *   tour     ./tour-steps.ts over the live shell: the walk on Home ("1, 2,
 *            3"), the first time Home shows after that first visit to the
 *            app, and "Look around first"'s four cards. Each card rings one
 *            place with the rest dimmed, and leads on with Next; Skip ends
 *            it where it is.
 *
 * An invite brings people in the same way (Evan, 15 Oct 2026: "You're in"
 * is gone). App._followInvite (public/js/app.js) and an invite accepted from
 * the notifications (Notifications._acceptInvite) call
 * `window.UsernodeReact.firstSession.welcome(info)`, once per account and
 * project (localStorage), when the link has just let the viewer in: it opens
 * the app itself, full screen, with the tip ("<inviter> invited you"), and
 * somebody new to Homeroom (a private member, or an account the link's
 * sign-up made) gets the walk on their first Home after it. Somebody who had
 * an account before gets the tip alone. It answers false when it will not
 * show, and the caller lands them where it always did.
 *
 * The same island is the platform's one front door for a new project: the
 * Create button (App.showCreateModal, public/js/app.js) opens
 * "What do you want to make?" through `create()`, with `entry` 'create'
 * (`create({ import: true })`, from #create/import, opens it on importing a
 * GitHub repo). From there it ends on the project's hub rather than on the
 * first session's tip and walk, and it answers nothing the first session
 * asks (noteAnswered).
 *
 * A sign-in from the invite's own page (Join, then the sheet) is followed in
 * the tick the signed-in shell starts, and the link's standing, which says
 * whether to welcome them, is a request away: Home showed for that long
 * before the welcome (Evan, 5 October 2026). So the follow asks for a held
 * frame first, `holdWelcome()`, drawn at once (flushSync) on the landing's
 * wallpaper, before the shell draws Home; welcome() hands it to the app,
 * and it goes once the app is on screen (appDrawn). `endHold()` takes it
 * down for any other ending. The make screen's own hand-off (#3894) works
 * the same way.
 *
 * ── The island rules ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It renders NOTHING until it is opened, so the prerendered shell is
 * unchanged, and only a press opens it, so the first client render matches.
 * Nothing in `public/js/**` writes into it; the legacy shell is only CALLED
 * (App.navigateHome, App.navigateToApp). The spotlight's geometry is
 * measured each frame from the target the step names and kept in state only
 * when it moves.
