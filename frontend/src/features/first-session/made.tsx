/**
 * Right after "Make it" (./make.tsx): something to give, and one thing to
 * do with it.
 *
 *   bar       The Homeroom logo bar, as on the story, the invite page and
 *             the make screen (owner, 7 October 2026), so the first session
 *             reads as one product from the story to the tour. It stays
 *             behind the invite sheet. From Create, under the platform's own
 *             header, there is none.
 *   who       Your face in the middle with waiting seats on both sides
 *             (./people-row.tsx, canvas People.dc.html). As people join,
 *             their faces take the seats: the project's community is read
 *             once, then every ten seconds while an invite is out. No line
 *             says who joined as well (decided 6 October 2026).
 *   title     "Your new community", small, as the screen's heading. Then,
 *             16px under it, the thumbnail, which carries the name: a big
 *             name over the card said it twice (owner, 7 October 2026,
 *             canvas v78). The faces, the heading and the thumbnail are one
 *             block, centred between the logo bar and the line over the
 *             buttons.
 *   what      The project's thumbnail (./sketch-card.tsx) with the build
 *             line one line under it (#4053, ./build-line.tsx: "Homeroom bot
 *             is planning it") from GET /api/apps/:slug
 *             (`app.first_version`), read again every ten seconds, past the
 *             service worker's cache (madeAppOf, madeAppUrl). When the plan
 *             waits, only that line changes ("Your plan is ready to review",
 *             in blue), as it does on every screen. Nothing here asks for an
 *             answer: the plan waits until the tour ends, and the "Needs you"
 *             card that asked for it before anyone was invited is gone from
 *             the first session (Evan's test, 6 October 2026). From Create,
 *             which has no tour, the card stays (PlanWaitsCard). A project Homeroom bot does not
 *             build has no line, and one quiet note under the card says who
 *             builds it (NO_BOT_NOTE).
 *   invite    One quiet line, "Invite people to use it and help improve it
 *             together.", over Share invite and Invite people later. Once the
 *             link has gone out the line says so ("Invite shared. Next, a
 *             short tour.", or "Link copied. Next, a short tour."), and the
 *             buttons keep their places: Share again, grey, where Share
 *             invite was, and Start the tour, blue, where Invite people later
 *             was (owner, 8 October 2026). Invite people later and Start the
 *             tour both start the tour (./index.tsx). From Create there is no
 *             tour: the line says "Invite shared." or "Link copied." and the
 *             second button goes to the project (continueLabel).
 *
 * Nothing under the two buttons.
 *
 * The sheet is the first invite, not the project's full invite pane
 * (features/app-context/invite-pane.tsx, with live links, their limits, an
 * invite by username and the project's joining rule, which stays where it
 * is): its title ("Invite people to Sunday Run Club"), a small caps "What
 * they'll see" over the invite as they will see it ("alex invited you to
 * Sunday Run Club" and the note, edited in place), then Share link and Copy
 * link (inviteActions: which one leads depends on the device, #4180).
 * Nothing else: somebody brand new knows nobody on Homeroom to invite by
 * username yet, and the joining rule is the project's business later (both
 * taken out after Evan's run-through, 5 October 2026). The link it makes
 * stops after a week or 25 people (LINK_DAYS, LINK_USES), and the sheet says
 * so. A note they wrote themselves and shared (the share sheet, not Copy
 * link) is also the maker's first message in the group's chat (the sheet
 * says so, #4238), so the people it brings find it waiting there. The note is
 * kept per project on this device
 * (noteKey), else read back from the maker's own newest link.
 *
 *   sketch    The thumbnail is made from the description in a few seconds
 *             (services/app-sketch.js): its emoji, now the project's icon,
 *             and a tagline. The same frame stands while it is sketched.
 *             Without one (a project with no sketch, or one that never came)
 *             it says the description instead.
 *
 * Every line says what is true for this project: when Homeroom bot builds
 * it (`made.conversationId`, its DM), the build line; when it does not, the
 * description is the project's first request, for whoever builds it. Nothing
 * says how long a first version takes (buildNote).
 *
 * FROM CREATE TOO, IMPORTS INCLUDED. Every new project lands here: from the
 * first session, from the Create button's make screen, and from its import
 * form (`made.imported`, ./import-repo.tsx), which is the retired New
 * project dialog's last job. So this screen also says what that dialog's
 * progress view used to: a setup that stopped (status `error`, with Try
 * again, POST /api/apps/:slug/retry) or one waiting on its secrets
 * (`awaiting_secrets`, with Set secrets, which an imported repo can declare),
 * in a card under the project (SetupStoppedCard). An import
 * has no sketch and nothing built from a description: its lines say it is
 * being imported, then that it runs (buildLine, buildNote). Every one is a
 * private community, so every one ends on Share invite.
 *
 * READY-MADE (Evan, 8 October 2026). A choice on the make screen that needs
 * no typing (a tier list of restaurants, the grocery list, ...) makes one of
 * Homeroom's ready-made apps (services/app-templates.js, `made.readyMade`):
 * nothing is sketched or built, so like an import its lines say it is being
 * set up, then that it is ready to use.
