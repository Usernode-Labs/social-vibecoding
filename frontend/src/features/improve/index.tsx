/**
 * The Improve island: no markup any more, just the subscription that keeps
 * the store honest, and the import that publishes `window.Improve`.
 *
 * ── The panel is retired (#2718 review) ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * It was a drawer opened from a row in the mark's menu, holding two buttons,
 * a list of sessions and a build notice. The Workshop took the sessions
 * earlier in this issue, which left a drawer you opened to press one of two
 * buttons. Those and the notice are rows of the menu now
 * (../app-context/app-context-sheet.tsx renders ./actions.tsx), and the
 * drawer went with the row that opened it.
 *
 * This island still EXISTS because the controller has to be imported
 * somewhere for `window.Improve` to be there before `public/js/app.js` looks
 * for it — the same reason every other feature folder imports its
 * classic-side module from the island rather than from main.tsx — and because
 * the live session store has to be subscribed from a mounted component.
