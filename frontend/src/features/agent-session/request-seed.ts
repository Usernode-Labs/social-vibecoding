// Start work on a request card opens an UNSENT conversation (store.ts,
// openDraft). It used to open with only the request's number in its hint:
// the Mayor learned the request from the session's focus once the first
// message was sent, but the screen said nothing about it and the box was
// empty, so it read as a blank conversation. Now the screen names the
// request and the box holds a first message for it, unsent and editable, as
// the dev chat's Start work seeds its box (app-view.js, createPrForIssue).
//
// The title rides in the hint from the card that had it. It is the screen's
// alone: the server resolves the request from its number (serverHint in
// ./api.ts drops the title), and the Mayor reads the request in full itself,
// which is why the seed names it rather than pasting its description.
