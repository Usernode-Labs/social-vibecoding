/**
 * The project page's Discussion tab: the community's channel, whole, in
 * place.
 *
 * The hub shows the discussion's last line and a way in (./hub-cards.tsx
 * ForYouCard, its Discussion row). The way in used to leave the page
 * for `#messages/app/<slug>`; it is a tab of the page now, so a person
 * reading the hub and a person talking in the room are on the same page with
 * the same coloured header, and Back is the tab strip rather than a screen
 * swap.
 *
 * ── The same room, mounted the way Messages mounts it ─────────────────
 *
 * The pane is group-chat's (AppView.renderGroupChatTab: the stream, the
 * composer, drafts, the @ and # menus), mounted into a host this component
 * renders empty and never writes into again: the one-owner rule satisfied at
 * the host's boundary, as in features/messages/index.tsx AppDiscussionThread,
 * whose effect this copies, timer and teardown order included (#2783: the
 * composer is wired on the line after the portal is published, which cannot
 * happen inside React's commit).
 *
 * ── Homeroom's own room is #general, in place too (#3494) ─────────────
 *
 * Its channel is #general, a conversation of the Messages store rather than
 * an app chat. It used to be a door: the tab opened #general on the Messages
 * screen, which swapped the page's header, its tabs and its colour for
 * Messages' own (#3491). Now the tab turns like every other project's and
 * the room is drawn here, under the same header — Messages' own thread,
 * composer and reply threads (features/messages/index.tsx
 * EmbeddedConversation), holding the store's one route while this page is
 * the screen on show. `generalRoom` reads which conversation it is.
 *
 * ── Every way into the room ends here, at its place (#3653) ───────────
 *
 * A notification, a message link, a `#name` reference or an old address of
 * the room used to open it on a page of its own, with its own back button.
 * They come to this tab now (app.js App.openDiscussionInHub and the
 * router's redirects), carrying what they named in the room as a TARGET
 * (AppView._stashDiscussionTarget): a reply thread, opened beside the room
 * here as it opens beside it in Messages, or a message, brought into view
 * and flashed. The tab takes it when it shows the room, and again when a
 * door is followed while the room is already up. A reply thread opened from
 * the room itself comes the same way (public/js/group-chat.js
 * openReplyThread), with no address of its own: the page's address is the
 * page's, as it is for #general's threads.
 *
 * ── A topic's channel, too (#4417) ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A project's channels are #general and its TOPICS: lasting conversations
 * about one part of it, each a channel and a category at once (a category
 * row with origin 'topic'; ./places.ts). The place names which (`channel`,
 * a handle; null or `general` is #general), and a topic's channel is its
 * 'category' thread on the app's own chat, under the topic's line
 * (./topic-head.tsx). On Homeroom's own project too, where #general is a
 * Messages conversation and the topics are threads of the app's chat: the
 * list hides the difference.
 *
 * #4417 follow-up: THE TOPIC'S ROOM IS #general's PANE. A topic's channel
 * is the general stream one level down (src/routes/chat.js selectStream:
 * its own messages, and the replies of the reply threads that start in it),
 * so it is mounted the way a project's own #general is
 * (AppView.renderGroupChatTab, in a host this component renders empty),
 * scoped to the topic (`channel`, GroupChat._channel). It was a thread
 * mount, and the group chat holds one thread at a time, so its messages
 * could not open reply threads of their own. Now they do, beside it, in
 * the same pane #general's open in (AppReplyThreadPane), and a door that
 * names a place in it (a notification's `m/<id>` or `thread/<root>`) is
 * taken here as #general's door is there, by its topic (`topicRef`).
 *
 * A retired topic (archived, or merged into another) is read-only, with its
 * whole history. A topic that others were merged into draws one card in its
 * history for each, where the merge happened (./merged-topic-card.tsx),
 * handed to the history as markers: nothing was posted for them.
