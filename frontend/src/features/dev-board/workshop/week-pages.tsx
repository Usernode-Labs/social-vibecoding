/**
 * The weeks, on the Workshop tab (#4457, and #3947 before it; After-Workshop-B,
 * Oct 2026).
 *
 * The weeks used to unfold inside Since your last visit, and each week's
 * rows unfolded again inside the week ("Seen before", "Show 5 more · 25
 * left", "Show an earlier week"): two levels of the same gesture, nested,
 * and a quiet visit read "Nothing has changed since you were last here."
 * over thirty rows of history. The information hierarchy was right; the
 * nesting was not.
 *
 * Now the tab's What happened card leads with THIS WEEK (`ThisWeek`): its
 * name and dates, how many of its rows are new to you and how many changes
 * went live, then its rows newest first, one line each (`HappenedRow`: a
 * dot when it is new since your last visit, "You" on your own, "Going
 * live" on a merge still rolling out, and when), the new ones and a few
 * you have seen, then "All of this week". Every other week is ONE ROW
 * (`WeekRow`): its name and dates and how many went live. Either opens the
 * week as its own page inside the tab, with "‹ Workshop" to go back, and
 * the page groups the week: New since your last visit (when any), Waiting
 * for votes, Went live, New requests, Being worked on, under the week's
 * summary line. "Earlier weeks" adds rows to the same list. Nothing
 * unfolds inside anything; a long group shows its first few rows and "Show
 * all N" puts the rest under them.
