/**
 * The Workshop's row (#4457, #4486): one item, in one hairline-divided list.
 *
 * ONE ROW, THREE SURFACES. A week's page on the Workshop tab, All items'
 * board columns and its By category lanes all draw this row now (#4486);
 * the Workshop tab's Your work and New for you draw its shorter sibling,
 * `ActRow`, below (After-Workshop-B), and its What happened its own one-line
 * row (./week-pages.tsx HappenedRow). The board and By category
 * used to draw the folded card (../card/fold.tsx), which wore a coloured
 * edge and a coloured glyph the column already said, named its author and
 * its provenance twice, and unfolded in place under a ⇕. A row here is:
 *
 *   - on the Workshop tab, a neutral tile (what kind of thing it is: the tab
 *     mixes requests, changes and live work in one list); none on the board,
 *     whose column says it;
 *   - the title, 15px;
 *   - one line in the board's words: "PR #4456 · evan · for #4452 and #4455
 *     · 4m ago", "#4417 · evan · 8h ago" (`rowWords`);
 *   - a tags line: on live work the card's own "✓ Live" bar at its words'
 *     width first, then the card's coloured category chip and its 💬 count
 *     (dev-card.tsx's own pieces, unchanged), then small tags for what is
 *     happening on it ("Picked up · zura", "Checks passed",
 *     AppView._workshopBrief), and on the Workshop tab the card's coloured
 *     category chip and its 💬 count. #4718: a change's status pill and
 *     Vote no longer ride this line — they take a line of their own under
 *     it, at the row's far end, on every width, so rows beside each other
 *     keep the same shape whatever the tags' length;
 *   - ☰, the card's own menu trigger with the card's own key, so
 *     `_toggleCardMenu`, the touch action sheet and every item in it work
 *     unchanged;
 *   - on the board, under all that, the card's status bar and Vote across
 *     the row (fold.tsx `RowBand`), except on live work.
 *
 * THE ROW OPENS THE ITEM'S PAGE. Its title is a real link to the page's
 * route, stretched over the row (app.css `.dev-ws-wrow-link::after`), so a
 * modified click, a middle click and "Open in new tab" are the browser's,
 * and on a phone a tap is that link: the page takes the screen. On a wide
 * window the Workshop catches the plain click and opens the same page in the
 * panel beside the list or the board (`onOpen`, ./side-panel.tsx). The chips,
 * the bar, Vote and ☰ sit above the stretched link, so each does its own job.
 *
 * THE HOOKS. A board row carries the item's `data-issue-row` and its
 * siblings, as the folded card it replaces did: the declared checks name an
 * item by them, and the Done column's scroll anchor and the attribute
 * popover's fallback anchor look items up by them. The delegated `#dev-body`
 * handler that opens a card full-screen on those hooks stands aside for a
 * click inside any row (`AppView._inFoldWrapper`), because the row's own
 * link does that job. The Workshop tab's rows carry none (`data-ws-open`
 * names the item instead), as they never have.
