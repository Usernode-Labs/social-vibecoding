/**
 * The project page's hero: what this is, who it is for, and Join, at the top
 * of the project's own Workshop page, above where the app is.
 *
 * ── Why it leads the page ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every project belongs to one community (src/services/communities.js), and
 * while the two are one-to-one the community is drawn AS its project: there
 * is no separate community page, so the facts that are the community's
 * rather than the code's live on the page the Workshop tab's row opens. The
 * page used to open on its dashboard, four numbers about the code, with the
 * community in a card under it; a person arriving from Discover or a shared
 * link met "18 open items" before they met the thing's name. So the page
 * leads with identity, the way a profile does, and the dashboard follows:
 *
 *   WHAT IT IS. The app's tile and name, the page's one large heading (the
 *   header chip's, from the page's own store), over who it is for, and
 *   dapp.json's one-line description when it has one (HeroIdentity).
 *
 *   WHO IT IS FOR. The audience, in the words people see (Public community,
 *   Private community, Just you), with how many are in it, "Public community
 *   · 266 members", under the name; and for a public or a private community
 *   WHO IS AROUND: this week's faces, "40 active this week" and their names
 *   (HeroActive). That is all the hub says about activity: it is who is
 *   here, not a dashboard of how they performed. The fortnight's small
 *   chart that sat beside the faces (#3268) is gone, and the hub draws no
 *   charts.
 *
 *   JOIN, JOINED, INVITE, ⋯. Membership sits across from the name, because
 *   it is a fact about you and this project, the way a profile's Follow
 *   sits across from the person's name. An outsider sees Join, which asks
 *   in a popup under itself (below). A member sees Joined, which is also
 *   the way out: a tap asks before leaving, the same pill Discover draws.
 *   What you can DO here ends the members row: Invite opens Members &
 *   approvals, where the roster, invites and approvers are managed, for
 *   exactly whom the ⋯ menu offers it, and the ⋯ itself (`menu`, the
 *   page's DevPlusMenu) holds Suggest an improvement and the project's settings.
 *   This hero lists; it does not manage.
 *
 *   MAKE IT PUBLIC. Who a project is for can grow after it exists: Invite
 *   makes a Just-you project a private community, and "Make it public" (it
 *   was "Open it up") makes it a public one. Taking a public community back
 *   is "Make it private", a row of the ⋯ rather than a button here
 *   (confirmMakePrivate): narrowing who a project is for is a setting, not
 *   an invitation, and the hero's row is for asking people in. That is the
 *   visibility change the settings dialog proposes, POST
 *   /api/apps/:slug/visibility-pr, offered to the same people the route
 *   lets open it (`can_manage`). It is a PROPOSAL, not a switch: dapp.json
 *   says who a project is for, so the change is voted in like any other
 *   line of it and applies once it merges. While one is up, the hero says
 *   so and links to it instead of offering a second.
 *
 *   HOW A CHANGE GETS IN is not on the hero any more. The approval rule is
 *   the last line of the Workshop's Overview card (ApprovalLine, below),
 *   beside the work it governs: on the hero it was a line about process
 *   between who is here and the channel.
 *
 *   WHERE THEY TALK is no longer a row here. The channel has a card of its
 *   own on the hub (./hub-cards.tsx), with its last messages, because it
 *   lives on the hub now rather than in Messages.
 *
 * Joining is what lets you take part here. The button asks the question every
 * join_required refusal asks, through lib/join-required.ts's offerJoin, and
 * while it shows it registers itself as that app's anchor, so a refusal from
 * anywhere on this page asks in the same popup.
 *
 * ── The island rules it keeps ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The hero's community half waits for its read: the fetch runs in an
 * effect, the first render is the identity alone (or nothing, without a
 * name), and a failed read leaves just that, rather than drawing an error
 * where nothing was asked for.
