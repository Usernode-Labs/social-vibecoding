/**
 * The card's ⋯ overflow menu, as a view model.
 *
 * ── The host is the module's, the rows are React's ────────────────────
 *
 * `public/js/app-view.js` creates the floating element, appends it to
 * `document.body`, places it against the trigger, owns the dismissers, and —
 * the interesting part — RE-ANCHORS it after a board repaint. Every repaint
 * replaces `#dev-body`, and the board repaints on its own schedule (the
 * session poll, the headless poll, every websocket push), so the menu survives
 * by finding its successor trigger by key and re-filling its rows in place.
 * That is why the rows are a publish and not a re-mount: the click listener is
 * bound ONCE on the host, and it has to keep working across every refresh.
 *
 * ── Descriptors were already the design ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * A card registers `{ label, title, icon, disabled, danger, act }` under a
 * stable key and emits a trigger carrying it; one delegated handler looks the
 * list up and presents it. That existed so the same list could render as an
 * anchored dropdown on a pointer device and as a native action sheet on touch.
 * This adds a third consumer of the same descriptors and takes nothing away:
 * `act` never crosses into React — the row publishes its INDEX and the module
 * calls the handler, which is what keeps the "read the CURRENT descriptor
 * list, not the one captured when the menu opened" rule intact.
