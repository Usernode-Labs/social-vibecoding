/**
 * The card's ⋯ overflow menu rows, as the only React writer below that host.
 *
 * See ./card-menu-store.ts for the split. Two things about this file are
 * deliberate and easy to undo by accident:
 *
 *   * NO onClick. The dispatch is a delegated `click` bound once on the host
 *     by `_toggleCardMenu`, and it must stay there: the menu SURVIVES a board
 *     repaint (the trigger it was anchored to is destroyed and a successor is
 *     found by key), and the handler deliberately reads the CURRENT descriptor
 *     list rather than the one captured when the menu opened. It also stamps
 *     `AppView._menuActEvent` so a popover the row opens is not dismissed by
 *     the same click as it finishes bubbling. A per-row handler would lose the
 *     first property and have to re-implement the second.
 *   * `data-menu-idx` is that handler's whole contract with these rows, and
 *     `data-menu-row` is what a screenshot request and a declared check aim
 *     at. Both are attributes rather than props for that reason.
