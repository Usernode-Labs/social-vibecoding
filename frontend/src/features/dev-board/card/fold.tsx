/**
 * The card, folded — and the fold that opens it.
 *
 * One item on the Dev screen has two sizes: the one-line ROW (icon, title,
 * number and author, a mini status band, the vote button where there is
 * one) and the dense CARD the Board has always drawn. The Workshop's lanes
 * introduced the row and the fold between them (#1787); the Board's columns
 * use the same fold now, so a column of forty items is forty rows and the
 * one you tapped, rather than forty cards. This module is where both
 * surfaces get them from, so the two can never drift apart.
 *
 * ── Either the row or the card, never both ───────────────────────────
 *
 * `CardRowView` renders ONE of the two. The row is a compressed
 * representation of the card, so opening it swaps it for the card whole
 * rather than growing a hybrid with the row as a head and the card
 * de-chromed under it (#1799 did that; it read as a third object belonging
 * to neither size). The open card carries an "Open card" pill at the end of
 * its action band, and that pill is the item's full-screen route — the same
 * link, with the same label, on both surfaces (#1884 round two). It used to
 * open the topic screen's sections in place on the Workshop and relabel to
 * "Open page ›" on a second tap, which meant one word meant two things
 * depending on which screen you had reached the card from. A card about the
 * viewer's OWN session carries one more link, "Open session", to the dev
 * chat behind it (#1887): the session is a destination inside the open
 * card, never what a tap on the row does — that tap unfolds the card, as
 * it does for every other kind.
 *
 * ── The item's hooks stay on, at both sizes ──────────────────────────
 *
 * Every card carries `data-issue-row` / `data-proposal-row` / `data-gov-row`
 * / `data-shared-session-row` / `data-session-chip`, and things key off
 * them: the declared checks name items by them, the live chat-count bump
 * and the flash-after-action look them up. The folded row carries the same
 * hook, so an item is findable whichever size it is at.
 *
 * What those hooks USED to do on a click is open the item full-screen,
 * through the delegated click handler app-view.js binds on `#dev-body`.
 * That handler now stands aside for any click whose path passed through a
 * `.dev-ws-rowwrap` (`AppView._inFoldWrapper`): the fold owns its clicks,
 * and the full-screen route is the link on the open card. The Workshop used
 * to get the same effect by stripping the hooks off the open card's model
 * (`withoutOpenHooks`); checking for the wrapper does the same job without
 * the model losing what the checks select on.
 *
 * One subtlety decides how that check is written. This component renders
 * through a portal, and React listens on the portal host, which sits
 * BELOW `#dev-body` — so React's handler runs first, and the state update
 * it makes is flushed in a microtask, which a real click runs between
 * listeners. By the time the event reaches `#dev-body` the row (or card)
 * that was clicked has been swapped for its other size: the target is
 * detached, and `closest()` from it cannot find the wrapper. The handler
 * reads the event's composed path instead, which is captured at dispatch.
