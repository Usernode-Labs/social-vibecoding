/**
 * The legacy → React seam for the Settings screen (#1191 slice 6,
 * conversion 8).
 *
 * `setFlush(flushSync)` for the same reason as the other converted screens:
 * `setSection()` calls `_renderNav()` and then `_renderContent()`, which reads
 * the DOM (`host.querySelectorAll('[data-settings-section]')`) and then calls
 * `_syncFooter()`, which reads `footer.parentElement`. Batched, the footer
 * move would measure the previous frame's column.
 *
 * Two plants, not imports, because ./settings.js is a classic IIFE with no
 * exports and tests/settings-mobile-push.test.js runs its real source through
 * `vm.runInContext` — see ./settings-nav-store.js's header.
 *
 *   * `_store` — the two nav hosts' descriptors.
 *   * `_footerHome` — the placeholder seam for `#settings-footer`, which
 *     `_syncFooter()` physically re-parents into the content column on a
 *     phone. There is no portal here and there is no kit surface either: the
 *     node just moves, and the comment left in its place keeps the slot React
 *     rendered it into open. Created lazily, on first use, because the
 *     element only exists once the island has hydrated.
