//
// The Settings row in the header drawer is a real anchor to #settings;
// App.restoreFromHash → App.navigateToSettings mounts #settings-screen and
// hands rendering to this module, the same shape as the Challenges /
// Profile / Admin console screens. Users can paste an `sk-ant-...` key; the
// server verifies it with a cheap 1-token call and only then encrypts
// + stores it. Once saved, a small emerald dot appears on the drawer's
// Settings row so the user can tell at a glance that their key is
// active — and so can any other user viewing over their shoulder
// (no secrets leak, just the indicator).
//
// LAYOUT (mirrors features/admin/admin-console.js — read that file's header for
// the reasoning, this is the same shell with different data):
//
//   desktop (md+)          a grouped sidebar of sections + the active
//                          section beside it, switched in place;
//   level 1 (#settings)    below md, the grouped section menu, one tappable
//                          row per section under the same headings;
//   level 2 (#settings/<k>) that one section, full width, with the platform
//                          header's back button flipped to an arrow and its
//                          title set to the section label.
//
// The hash is the single source of truth for WHICH section shows; the level
// is derived from it (bare #settings on mobile = the menu). A menu tap is a
// REAL hash navigation, so it pushes a history entry and the device /
// WebView back gesture pops back to the menu through exactly the same code
// path as the on-screen arrow (see _openSection / handleBack / route).
//
// MOVE, DON'T REWRITE: the section markup is STATIC in index.html and every
// control is bound by id exactly once in init(). The router only toggles
// `hidden` on the [data-settings-section] WRAPPERS — it never rebuilds a
// section, because that would silently detach every listener. Each
// section's own `hidden` (the wallet / usernode / admin-preview capability
// gates) keeps living on the INNER node, which is also how _visibleSections
// derives menu membership without duplicating those gates.

  // net is armed the moment the native call is issued, so the page leaves
  // within this bound whatever the app does. It is safe to leave early:
  //
  //   - Nothing can sign back in. /api/auth/logout deleted the web session
  //     and, in the same transaction, revoked the native credential tied to
  //     it (src/routes/auth.js), and its response cleared the cookie.
  //   - Native cleanup does not need this document once it has started: the
  //     app holds its lifecycle queue until it has deleted the WebView's
  //     cookies, storage and cache, then replaces the WebView itself, so a
  //     landing page that arrived first is simply replaced again.
  //   - Native gets a fair chance first. Its whole teardown normally takes a
  //     second or two; eight is several times that. If the app has not even
  //     admitted the call by then, its credential is already revoked server
  //     side, and the app retires it the first time the server refuses it.

  //     work is already done.
  //   - The ordinary WEB path has no such guarantee: only the server can
  //     revoke a web session, so abandoning the request means the sign-out did
  //     NOT happen and the user is told so. The budget is therefore generous —

    // Parts that share a `page` are shown together as ONE row of the nav and

    // keyed by its own key. Page labels live in PAGES; a one-part page uses
    // its part's label.

     * Wire one Copy button (#1290).

     * Three of them live on this screen — the connector URL and the two
     * allow-rule blocks — and before this they were three ad-hoc handlers
     * that each got something wrong: the URL one wrote 'Copied' even when
     * `writeText` had rejected, none of them went through
     * `PlatformUI.copyText` (so an insecure origin or a locked-down webview
     * failed silently instead of taking the execCommand fallback every other
     * copy on the platform gets), none toasted, and none held onto the reset
     * timer, so a second press cut the first press's confirmation short.
     *
     * `read` and `selectOnFail` are called at CLICK time so the source can
     * change under the button — which it does: the name-spelling field
     * rewrites both <pre> blocks in place.
     *
     * textContent only, never innerHTML: these buttons are rendered by
     * Shell.tsx and a glyph would need markup React owns.
     *
     * `successMessage` and `failureMessage` are message ids, read at click
     * time.
