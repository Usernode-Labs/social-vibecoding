/**
 * App AI permissions (issue #34). Lists every app the user has granted access
 * to their daily AI budget: today's spend vs the per-app cap, a cap editor,
 * the BYOK spillover toggle, and Revoke — and, on a revoked row, Re-enable
 * (#1957), so the way back does not depend on the app asking again.
 *
 * `#llm-grants-list` is React-owned end to end now (../grants-list.tsx).
 * Settings._renderLlmGrants() still does the fetching, on section open, from
 * GET /api/me/llm-grants (?demo=1 passthrough in staging) — it publishes a
 * view model rather than building rows. The host stays an EMPTY div at first
 * render, which is what the prerender emits and what hydration has to match.
