/**
 * The language preference: one per-user BCP-47 locale, "" (Auto) = unset
 * (NULL in the DB). It is the language Homeroom's own screens use, among the
 * languages that ship (lib/i18n), and the default apps read through the iframe
 * JWT `locale` claim and the bridge's usernode.getUserLocale() (issue #757).
 * settings.js saves on change, through the language runtime, which also pushes
 * `usernode:locale-changed` into any open app iframe.
 *
 * The choices are Auto and the shipped languages (frontend/locales/config.json):
 * English only, today. A locale saved when this picker listed more, or through
 * the API, is added as an option by Settings._renderLanguageSection, so it
 * stays visible and changeable rather than reading as "Auto".
 *
 * #settings-locale is a dapp.json anchor and settings.js reads/writes its
 * `.value`, so it stays a native `<select>` — see @/components/ui/select.
 *
 * Offered to everyone. #1556 had hidden it from anyone without a saved locale,
 * because a "Language" row that could not change the screen read as a broken
 * switch; the text below now says what it does. #settings-language-section is
 * kept as the id the baseline and settings.js know.
 *
 * This pane holds no state, so React never reconciles the option settings.js
 * adds away from under it.
