/**
 * App device permissions (#2219). Lists every app the user has let reach a
 * gated browser capability — location, microphone, camera, screen sharing, or
 * a USB / serial / input / Bluetooth / MIDI device — with Revoke, and
 * Re-enable on a revoked row.
 *
 * The one thing this copy must be honest about is WHEN a revoke bites. A
 * frame's Permissions Policy is computed from its `allow` attribute at
 * navigation and cannot be narrowed afterwards, so a running app keeps what
 * it already holds until it is reopened. Saying "takes effect immediately"
 * here, as the AI section truthfully can, would be wrong.
 *
 * `#app-permissions-list` is React-owned end to end (../app-permissions-list.tsx);
 * Settings._renderAppPermissions() does the fetching on section open and
 * publishes a view model. The host stays an EMPTY div at first render, which
 * is what the prerender emits and what hydration has to match.
