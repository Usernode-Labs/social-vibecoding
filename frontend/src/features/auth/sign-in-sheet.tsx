/**
 * Sign-in as a sheet: the email code, asked for over the screen that led
 * to it rather than on a screen of its own, so what you are joining stays in
 * view behind it. "Made for you" opens it from its Join button
 * (./invite-card.tsx), titled for the project.
 *
 * It is the same exchange as the sign-in screen's email-code panel
 * (./login.tsx), against the same routes:
 *
 *   email    POST /api/auth/otp/request sends a six-digit code.
 *   code     POST /api/auth/otp/verify. An account that has a password is
 *            signed straight in; a new one (or one with no password yet)
 *            moves on to
 *   account  POST /api/auth/otp/set-password: a password, and the username
 *            when the account has none, which mints the session.
 *
 * Continue with Apple and Continue with Google come first when an admin has
 * set them up (`providers`, from the waitlist options). Either leaves
 * the page for the provider (GET /api/auth/oauth/:provider/start) and comes
 * back to it signed in, or (`resume`) to this sheet: at
 *
 *   username POST /api/auth/oauth/finish, when the provider's sign-in made
 *            an account that has no username yet, which mints the session;
 *   or the first step again, with what went wrong.
 *
 * Inside the Homeroom app the providers' pages refuse its web view, so
 * (`native`) the buttons ask the app for its own sheet instead and never
 * leave the page (signInNatively): the same outcomes, answered in place.
 *
 * An invite's Join asks for a phone number first (`phone`, whenever the
 * server offers phone sign-in): an invite makes a private member, and a
 * private member signs up with a phone (services/community-invites.js
 * joinAsPrivateMember), against routes/phone-auth.js:
 *
 *   phone       Your name and a phone number. POST /api/auth/phone/request
 *               texts a code, after an invisible reCAPTCHA (./recaptcha.ts)
 *               Firebase asks of a web caller.
 *   phone-code  POST /api/auth/phone/verify with the code and the name. A
 *               number already on an account signs it straight in; a new
 *               one is made with that name, and a PROVISIONAL handle picked
 *               from it that only the inviting group sees, and signed in
 *               too: no username step (routes/phone-auth.js). The first
 *               public place asks for a username (username-first-run.js
 *               askForPublic). A public community's invite asks no name
 *               (`askName` false), and so, like a client that sends none or
 *               a name no handle could be picked from, moves on to
 *   username    POST /api/auth/phone/finish, the provider's step with the
 *               phone's own route, which mints the session.
 *
 * Under the phone step, past an "or", Continue with Apple and Continue with
 * Google when an admin has set them up (the same buttons as the first step's
 * otherwise), then "Already on Homeroom? Sign in with email", for an account
 * made before; one made by email from here is not a private member and
 * waits in the queue. That step still leads on to "Sign in with a password".
 *
 * "Sign in with a password" is a step of its own here too:
 *
 *   password POST /api/auth/login with a username or an email, the sign-in
 *            screen's own exchange (passwordSignIn in ./shared.ts). "Forgot
 *            password?" still goes to that screen's reset (#login/forgot).
 *
 * A waitlist "you're in" link opens the sheet already at work
 * (`releaseToken`): the address its token names filled in and the code
 * sent, as the sign-in screen does for the same link (./login.tsx), with
 * the same once-per-tab record of the send.
 *
 * Every success ends in finishLogin(), so where the person lands is the
 * shell's decision (AuthScreens.finishLogin, then the invite link's path).
 * `followInvite` tells the verify route that this sign-in is the Join the
 * person just pressed on an invite's page: an account that already existed
 * follows the link too (routes/auth.js), rather than being asked again.
 *
 * ── The way out to "What do you want to make?" ─────────────────────────
 *
 * When a sign-in leads to the account's first session, the story hands
 * this sheet `handOff` from its `beforeFinish`. The sheet slides away while
 * the wallpaper the make screen stands on comes up behind it, and only then
 * does the shell sign in, opening that screen in the same tick
 * (../first-session/index.tsx), so nothing of Home shows between the two.
 * Transform and opacity only, with no delay, so a busy main thread cannot
 * hold the movement back on iOS; with reduced motion it is a cut.
 *
 * Rendered in place inside the landing's React-owned tree (no portal, for
 * the reasons ui/dialog.tsx gives), closed by default, and only ever opened
 * once the screen is up (a tap, a provider's way back, a release link),
 * never in the first render, so the prerendered document is unchanged.
 *
 * ── With the keyboard up ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * iPhone 17 simulator, iOS 26 Safari, 5 Oct 2026, the password step: the
 * Sign in button sat behind the keyboard and the password field half under
 * the keyboard's floating bar (Return still signed in). The sheet sat on the
 * page's foot with the keys over it, and iOS panned the page to the tapped
 * field alone. The panel is a `.platform-kb-sheet` now: while the keyboard
 * is open its foot is on the top of what covers the page and its height is
 * capped to what is visible (lib/keyboard-open.ts, app.css), and it scrolls
 * inside. Taps on its fields focus without the pan, and the focused field is
 * revealed in the panel with the step's button under it when the two fit
 * (lib/keyboard-surface.ts). Every focus here is `preventScroll`, so that
 * reveal is the only movement. Every step is the same: email, code, account,
 * username, password, phone and its code. Return walks a step's fields, as
 * on the make screen (#3904): from any but the last it goes to the next
 * empty one, and only the
 * last field's Return (the keyboard says "go") submits (`returnTarget`). The
 * Homeroom app is losing the keyboard's ‹ › bar (flutter-mobile-app #603),
 * and nothing here leans on that bar: what covers the page is measured from
 * the visual viewport, whatever iOS draws above the keys.
 *
 * ── Opening it in the app, and what it is made of ──────────────────────
 *
 * Homeroom iOS app, 5 Oct 2026, Get started (and Sign in) recorded at 20
 * fps: the sheet put the caret in Email as it started sliding up, and the
 * app's web view raises its keyboard for a field focused from code, so the
 * keys came up WHILE the sheet rose. For a moment the sheet was behind the
 * rising keys, iOS scrolled the story up behind it to reveal the field, and
 * the sheet then jumped up onto the keys: three movements fighting for half a
 * second. On a touch screen the sheet now opens without a caret and the tap
 * on the field raises the keys, after the sheet has arrived; the sheet then
 * rides up with them as one eased, transform-only movement
 * (lib/keyboard-surface.ts `ride`), and back down with them. It moves a
 * caret to the next step's field by itself only while the keys are already
 * up (they stay up across the hop), or on a desktop, where no keyboard
 * rises (`mayFocusByCode`). Behind it nothing moves: the dim takes no pan
 * (`touch-action: none`, as the kit's own backdrop) and the panel does not
 * pass its scroll on to the page (`overscroll-contain`).
 *
 * The panel was a flat system grey (`bg-zinc-100`, a utility of its own, not
 * a token the signed-out page lacked). It is the platform's sheet now: the
 * plane colour (`--dc-sheet-solid`, the GroupedList's PLANE_FILL), the 20px
 * radius, the `--app-sheet-line` hairline, and the 36px handle in `--border`
 * that the workshop's sheets carry. The fields sit on it as white cards with
 * the same hairline, as on the make screen.
