/**
 * Which button on the signed-out pages a sign-up came from, for the
 * `user_signed_up` event (src/services/sign-up-from.js reads it).
 *
 * Each button notes itself as it opens a sign-in sheet: the story's
 * (./story.tsx: the hero's, Continue, its Sign in line), the "Want to join
 * in?" card's (../guest/guest-discover.tsx), and the landing's own (./landing.tsx:
 * the bar's Sign in and Sign up, what the visitor tried on a project's page,
 * and the sheet a shared link opens by itself). It travels
 * as a short-lived first-party cookie because one of the ways in leaves the
 * page and comes back: Apple's and Google's sign-ins finish on the
 * provider's callback, a top-level navigation that carries a SameSite=Lax
 * cookie and nothing the page held. An email code and a phone number finish
 * on a same-origin POST, which carries it too.
 *
 * It names a button and nothing about the person. Opening another sheet
 * replaces it; an hour on, it is gone. Kept in step with the server's list
 * (tests/sign-up-from.test.js).
