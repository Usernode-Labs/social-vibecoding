 * A conversation with unread messages opens where they begin.
 *
 * "when you go to a dm / discussion with unread messages, start so that the
 * top of the screen is where you've unread, and have a little unread banner,
 * like I think discord or slack does? And some little button to scroll down
 * / indicates you can scroll down, like claude does" (Evan, 5 Oct 2026).
 *
 * The first two read off one fact, where reading had stopped when the
 * conversation was opened (Messages' `unreadMark`, the group chat's
 * `_unreadMark`), taken from the server before the open reads it:
 *
 *   - the OPENING. The first unread message sits near the top of the
 *     transcript with a row or two of what was already read above it,
 *     unless everything new fits at the bottom, which is where it then opens;
 *   - the "New" LINE above that message, and a BANNER over the top of the
 *     transcript saying how many are new. The banner goes once the reader
 *     has scrolled onto the line or past it, or reached the bottom; a tap
 *     takes them back to the line. The line stays while the conversation is
 *     open;
 *
 * and the third reads only where the reader is:
 *
 *   - JUMP TO LATEST, a round button over the foot of the transcript
 *     whenever the reader is not at the bottom, with a dot when somebody
 *     wrote while they were away from it.
 *
 * Everything that decides is a pure function here, so a test can pin it;
 * the hooks only measure and call them.
