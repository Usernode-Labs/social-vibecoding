/**
 * A CHANNEL'S WAY BACK TO ITS HUB (#3407). A channel is a level inside its
 * community's hub (the hub's Channel card is its door), so its pane leads
 * with the same round chevron the hub's own pages (Needs you, the Workshop)
 * lead with. The header's arrow names the same place (store.ts channelHub);
 * this is the one in the page, where the reader already is.
 *
 * It is a door that says where it goes, so it lands on the hub itself, not
 * the tab that project page was last left on: AppView._landOnHub first, then
 * the hub's address (App._hubHref's spelling, the one Discover's rows follow).
 *
 * #general is the Homeroom community's channel, whose hub is the platform
 * project's. That slug is not known on a cold load: PlatformTarget.slug()
 * reads it off reads that may still be in flight (/api/version,
 * /api/platform/about, its own lookup), so the header SUBSCRIBES to it
 * (PlatformTarget.onSlug, fired wherever it becomes known) and draws the
 * label and the press from that one value (`generalHubBack`), so the two
 * can never disagree. Before anything knows it, the way back is Communities.
