/*
 * #4392: the bot's thanks for answering a first version's plan.
 *
 * Build it, tapped on the plan or typed under it, moves the request's
 * activity card under the plan (services/homeroom-bot-activity.js
 * cardUnderPlan). Until now that card was not drawn at all: its words
 * reached only the inbox's preview and the push, so the chat said nothing
 * after Build it. Now it is a message the maker sees: its words ("Thanks for
 * answering about the plan. I'll let you know when Run Club is ready to
 * try."), then a card for the app, the thumbnail row the hub draws
 * (../first-session/sketch-card.tsx ThumbRow: the icon tile in the
 * project's colour, and its name) with the build line under the name
 * (../first-session/build-line.tsx). The line follows the build from the
 * card's own state, read as every activity card is: "Building it · usually
 * 10 to 25 min", then "Testing it", then "Ready to try". A build that ended
 * any other way says how, in the activity card's words, with no spinner.
 *
 * The plan above keeps its step line and Notify me (./bot-plan.tsx): this
 * card is where the chat answers the tap, the plan is where the step is
 * counted.
