/*
 * #4097: what a Homeroom bot message is about, as its card.
 *
 * The bot names what a message is about in a line of its own, a paragraph
 * by itself, and its words follow after a blank line
 * (services/homeroom-bot-dm.js requestLine, and the offers in
 * services/homeroom-bot-mayor.js). In the transcript each line was bold text
 * and a number to decode. The row now draws the card that line names in its
 * place (./format.tsx ObjectCard, the card a shared item is):
 *
 *   "**Todo List** · request #93: Only close…"   the request's card
 *   "**Todo List**, its first version"           the project's card
 *   "**Todo List**" (setting up, or it failed)   the project's card
 *   "**Todo List** · proposal: Plant photos"     the change's card (an offer to withdraw it)
 *   "**Todo List** · new request: Dark mode"     a request not filed yet (an offer to file it)
 *
 * A line counts only on the bot's own message (botMeta is null for anyone
 * else) and only about what its metadata names: the same request number, or
 * the same project name. News leads with its line; the maker's hello comes
 * before the project's line; an offer's line follows the bot's reply.
 *
 * THE MESSAGE IS UNCHANGED. Its text still carries the line, so the inbox
 * preview, the bell, a push, a quote and Copy text still name it in words;
 * only the transcript draws it as a card, so every message the bot already
 * sent reads the new way too.
 *
 * WHERE A REQUEST'S CARD COMES FROM, best first: the request's card the
 * message already carries (drawn here instead of again under the words); the
 * server's reading of it for this reader, the one a pasted link to it gets
 * (./link-cards.tsx); and, until that answers or when it cannot, the card the
 * line itself describes, which says nothing the line did not. A change's
 * card is the one the offer carries. A project's card and a draft's are the
 * line's own: there is nothing more to read.
 *
 * NO "BY" AND NO STATUS on a request's card. On a request the platform filed,
 * GitHub's author is its own account. The status is GitHub's: a request whose
 * change went live is "closed", so "It's live now" sat under a card reading
 * "Todo List · closed", which reads as turned down. The words say where it
 * stands. A change's status is the platform's own words, and stays.
 *
 * ONE WAY IN. A first version that went live carries an Open button for the
 * same project, which a project card would only repeat: its line goes and
 * no card stands in.
