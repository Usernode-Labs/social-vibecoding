/*
 * B7: a change Homeroom bot built, ready to try, as a card in place of the
 * message's words (./message-row.tsx), which still say it for the inbox and
 * the push. Sent once its preview is up and its checks passed or were not
 * needed (services/homeroom-bot-dm.js noteChangeReady).
 *
 *   Try it            its preview, over the chat (AppView.ensureStaging);
 *   Approve           when the person's own Yes counts and is not in yet:
 *                     cast from THEIR browser, on the version the card was
 *                     sent for (api.approveChange). The bot never votes. On
 *                     a project of one person's it is the Yes that makes it
 *                     live;
 *   Change something  quotes the card in the composer, for the bot to
 *                     change it (its revise path).
 *
 * Under its title it says what the change is (changeLine): the change's own
 * title, else the request's, then what its person asked, if they did.
 *
 * A change its before & after shots showed part of failing, which the bot
 * could not fix in its own round, says what does not work instead of
 * calling itself ready (brokenLine).
 *
 * In a group the card says who else it waits on, and how many of them, when
 * fewer approvals are needed than the people it names (./approval-words.ts).
 * Once they approve, here or anywhere, the buttons give way to one line on
 * every device, which says what happens next (approvedLine): it goes live in
 * a minute or two, or when the others approve too, or after one more
 * approval from any of them, or on a day if nobody objects. A version that was
 * replaced since the card was sent approves nothing: the card says to try
 * the new version first, and Approve comes back once they have.
 *
 * READ AS IT STANDS NOW (5 October). The card is a message, sent once, and
 * Page Turners' still said "It goes live when one more person approves"
 * long after the change went live. So the DM's activity read also says where
 * each ready card's change stands now (services/homeroom-bot-dm.js
 * readyStates, kept by ./bot-activity-store.ts, read again on the bot's news,
 * on a merge or a close, and on any vote on the change): once it is live the
 * card says so (readyCardState: `live`), with no button: #4228, the news
 * that it went live, right under it, carries the one Open; while it is
 * merged it is going live; closed, it says it was closed; and
 * while it is up for approval, who it waits on and what happens next are
 * the counts as they are now, not as they were when it was sent.
