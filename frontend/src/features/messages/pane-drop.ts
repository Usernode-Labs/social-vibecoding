/**
 * Where a file dropped on a Messages thread goes (#6254): the pane owns the
 * drop, the composer that draws the thread's box owns the upload.
 *
 * A conversation and the reply thread beside it are siblings, each with its
 * own composer and its own scope (./store scopeKey), so a pane cannot hold
 * its composer as a child. This is the one link between them, keyed by that
 * scope: the composer registers the way it attaches files, the pane asks
 * whether one is drawn (so an awaiting or cannot-send thread shows no
 * outline) and hands a drop to it.
 *
 * Registration happens in an effect, so a pane that mounts first hears about
 * the composer once it is there. The last registration for a scope wins, and
 * its unregister removes only that one.
