/**
 * #platform-parked — the app you left, one tap above the tab bar.
 *
 * ./parked-store.js carries the argument for why it exists and why it is not
 * the recency list. What lives here is the things the strip has to get right
 * as a CONTROL.
 *
 * ── It is one target, and the ✕ is another ───────────────────────────
 *
 * The whole strip resumes the app — tile, name and pill alike — because a
 * shortcut whose tappable area is a 60px pill inside a full-width bar is a
 * shortcut you miss. The pill is a label INSIDE that target rather than a
 * button beside it: a nested button inside an anchor is invalid, browsers
 * split the markup on it, and it would give two targets where the design has
 * one plus a dismiss.
 *
 * The ✕ is that dismiss, and it means FORGET rather than hide: a strip that
 * comes back on the next screen swap is a strip you cannot get rid of, and
 * the handle's whole promise is that it is there until you are done with it.
 *
 * ── Resume goes BACK INTO the app, from wherever you are (#2762) ──────
 *
 * Since #2761 the mark's menu has no App segment, and this strip is the way
 * back into an app you stepped out of — including out to that same app's own
 * Workshop, discussion or change, which are platform screens with the bar up
 * and so show the strip. From there the app is still the one the router has
 * open, and re-opening it from scratch would reload a frame that is already
 * mounted. `App.openAppTab` is the router's own "this app, this tab" entry
 * point: it switches tabs for the open app and navigates for any other, and
 * it is what the chromeless pill uses for the same reason.
 *
 * ── It rides on the bar, and only where the bar is ─────────────────────
 *
 * The strip is a band on top of the platform's bar (a footer on the desktop
 * rail), so it is drawn exactly where that bar is: never over a running app,
 * never over the signed-out shell, never in chromeless. Before #2762 no app
 * was ever actually parked, so nothing asked; now one is kept in storage
 * across reloads, a reload can land on the signed-out shell, and the landing
 * screen must not offer the app. The bar's visibility is the store the bar
 * itself reads, and it is only ever applied as the `hidden` class below —
 * never rendered — so a value published before hydration cannot make the
 * first render disagree.
 *
 * On a FOLDED desktop rail the strip goes with the rail (app.css), and when
 * that rail peeks back over the page the strip rides on top of it. The
 * pointer crossing from the peeked rail onto the strip leaves the rail's
 * element, so the strip re-asserts the peek on its way in and hands back the
 * same grace period on its way out (./rail-peek.ts) — otherwise the rail and
 * the strip would fade away under the pointer that is about to press Resume.
 * Only while a peek is up: pointing at the strip never STARTS one.
 *
 * ── The initial render is the prerender ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * The root ships in the document with `hidden` and nothing inside it, which
 * is what the store's empty INITIAL renders. The app arrives from storage in
 * an effect, so the prerendered document and the first client render agree —
 * and the root has an id in the shell's frozen inventory either way, which a
 * conditionally rendered element could not.
 *
 * `hidden` lands through useHiddenClass rather than a rendered className, the
 * same seam the tab bar below it uses: the class string is a constant, and
 * the CSS that reserves this strip's band reads that class
 * (`body:has(#platform-parked:not(.hidden))`), so React must never be the one
 * rewriting the attribute.
 *
 * ── It arrives and leaves by the bar (#3376) ─────────────────────────
 *
 * On the phone the strip slides up out of the tab bar when an app is parked
 * and sinks back into it when the app is forgotten. Two phase classes carry
 * it (`platform-parked-enter` / `-leave`), toggled like `hidden` and never
 * rendered. While it leaves, the app it was drawing is kept in `leaving` so
 * the content stays put until `hidden` lands — on the leave keyframe's end,
 * or a timer, since `display: none` (keyboard up) runs no animation at all.
 *
 * Only a park or a forget while the bar stays up moves. The bar going away
 * (you entered the app, signed out) hides the strip at once — it must never
 * slide on its own over the app you are opening — and a stored app restored
 * on load is simply there, like the rest of the page. Reduced motion and the
 * desktop rail skip the leave entirely: hiding is instant, as it was.
 *
 * The root's clip is what animates, never a transform on it: a transform
 * would make the root the containing block for its fixed fake-glass layer,
 * which would then draw at strip size and snap back when the motion ended.
 * The children carry the slide (app.css).
 *
 * ── The app goes into it, and comes back out of it (#3618) ──────────
 *
 * Closing an app shrinks it into this strip, and Resume grows it back out:
 * the press notes the strip as the zoom's origin before the router opens the
 * app (./resume-motion.ts has the argument and the fallbacks). The pill is
 * the accent's, because Resume is an action.
