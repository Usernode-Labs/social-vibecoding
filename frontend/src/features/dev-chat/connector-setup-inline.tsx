/**
 * The connector walkthrough, inline on the dev session page (#2706).
 *
 * ── Why this exists ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The hand-off launchpad's third step asks for the Homeroom connector,
 * because without it the agent cannot call prepare_work and there is
 * nothing useful to hand it. Until now "Connect Homeroom" was a button
 * that assigned `#settings/connectors` — a whole screen away, in a pane
 * the reader has to scroll and a route they then have to find their way
 * back from, to satisfy one step of a walkthrough that is otherwise
 * self-contained. The request is to teach it HERE.
 *
 * So the steps come to the launchpad. The facts do not get retyped:
 * ../settings/connector-setup-steps holds the one copy of the Claude.ai
 * and ChatGPT walkthroughs and BOTH screens render it. Settings keeps its
 * route, untouched, and keeps everything this card deliberately does not
 * carry — the Claude Code permission rules, the Codex and generic-client
 * routes, the connector list itself. A launchpad step is not the place to
 * reproduce a settings pane; it is the place to answer the one question
 * the step just asked.
 *
 * ── A stateful island, and why that is allowed here ──────────────────
 *
 * Per AGENTS.md a region may hold state only when its whole subtree is
 * React-owned. This one is: it is rendered by view.tsx as an ordinary
 * child of the launchpad slot, beside (never inside) the innerHTML the
 * walkthrough card still comes from, and no public/js/** module looks any
 * node in here up. dev-chat.js owns whether it is on screen and reaches
 * back the same way OwnToolsGuide does — by name on `window.DevChat` —
 * because that module cannot import (see features/dev-chat/mount.ts).
 *
 * The URL is the live `${origin}/mcp`, passed in rather than written into
 * the prose, for the reason sections/connectors.tsx gives: a host spelled
 * out in copy goes stale on a fork or a config change.
