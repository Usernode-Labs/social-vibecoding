/**
 * The browse screen's rendered state (#1191 slice 6, conversion 3).
 *
 * ./browse.js keeps every decision it already made — the sort, the search
 * filter, the level derivation, the contributor cache, the fetches — and stops
 * making HTML. It pushes descriptors here; ./browse-list.tsx and
 * ./browse-detail.tsx render them.
 *
 * `level` moved in here too. _syncLevel() used to toggle `hidden` on
 * #browse-list-level, #browse-detail and #browse-search-bar from outside
 * React; those three nodes are rendered by ./browse-screen.tsx, so the toggle
 * is now a store field the component reads. (The SCREEN's own visibility is
 * still the shell's visibility-store — that is App._showOnlyScreen's business,
 * not this module's.)
 *
 * The initial value is the PRERENDER state: level 'list', nothing loaded. The
 * hand-written shell shipped #browse-list and #browse-empty empty, #browse-
 * empty and #browse-detail hidden, and #browse-list-level and the search bar
 * visible — which is exactly what these values render. Data loads in effects,
 * never here.
