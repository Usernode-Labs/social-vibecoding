 * The mark menu asks this for a private member who has not been Home yet: the
 * install banner stays down for them, and the menu's Go to Homeroom card
 * carries the offer instead. It is the banner's own decision (`installOffer`,
 * the same phone / native / standalone / member checks and the same store
 * listing fetch), minus the banner's dismissal: that ✕ answered an
 * unsolicited strip, and this row is in a menu somebody opened.
 *
 * Only an `a2hs` offer counts. A published store listing is the banner's to
 * link to; the How sheet this row opens is the home-screen steps.
