/**
 * `#mobile-install-banner` — the phone-browser strip offering the native app
 * (#1372).
 *
 * Sits directly under `#offline-banner`, and is the same SHAPE as it: an
 * in-flow `shrink-0` strip in the header column, which `public/css/app.css`
 * lifts to `position: fixed` while `body.has-install-strip` is set. That is
 * how the offline banner floats over content instead of displacing it, and
 * the two stack — offline at `z-60`, this at `z-59`, so a connectivity
 * warning is never covered by an advert for an app you cannot download while
 * offline.
 *
 * ── Why the body class ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A fixed strip covers whatever is at the top of the document, so the body
 * gains `padding-top` for exactly as long as the strip is up. `body` is not
 * React-owned (app.js writes `is-offline`, `is-view-as-non-admin` and others
 * to it), so toggling one more class from an effect is the established seam
 * rather than a new one.
 *
 * ── Why the markup renders even when there is nothing to offer ─────────
 *
 * AGENTS.md: an island's INITIAL render must emit exactly the empty/hidden
 * markup, with the data loaded in an effect. A first render that disagrees
 * with the prerendered document is a hydration mismatch, React `console.error`s
 * it, and a console error on any route fails proposal checks. So the strip is
 * always in the document, `hidden`, and the offer only ever toggles the class
 * through a ref — never the rendered `className`, which must stay a constant
 * for the reason lib/legacy-dom.ts explains.
 *
 * The practical consequence is worth stating plainly: with no store listing
 * published, `GET /api/public/mobile-app` answers `{ios: null, android: null}`
 * and this element is inert markup that no one ever sees. It turns itself on
 * the day an admin pastes a URL into App version.

 * the tab is open — refreshes and in-app navigation included, which is what
