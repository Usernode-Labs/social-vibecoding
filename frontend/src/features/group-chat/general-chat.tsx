/**
 * The general chat pane — the message stream, the status line, the composer
 * and the spec side-panel's slot — as the only React writer below
 * `#dev-chat-body`.
 *
 * ── Props, not a store ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Everything here is fixed for the life of one mount: the app's name, whether
 * the viewer is read-only, whether the first-arrival banner is due. It changes
 * only when `AppView.renderGroupChatTab` runs again, and `mountLegacyPortal`
 * re-renders with a new node and commits synchronously — so the props ARE the
 * publish. The parts that move while the pane is open (the staged reply, the
 * uploads, the error line, the typing text) go through ./composer-store.ts.
 *
 * ── The layout mirrors the dev-chat session view ──────────────────────
 *
 * A flex row holding the chat pane on the left and a slot for the spec side
 * panel on the right. The slot lives empty in the DOM so re-rendering this tab
 * does not tear down a panel the reader has open, and CSS switches it between
 * a side panel and a fullscreen modal at 1024px. The divider between them is
 * `display:none` until both the panel is open and the viewport is wide.
 *
 * ── Two hosts stay other owners' ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `#gc-messages` is the transcript's portal target and `#gc-spec-side-panel`
 * is the spec reader's — both rendered here as empty elements with constant
 * `className`, and both mounted into by features/group-chat/mount.ts. That is
 * the same arrangement `#gc-thread-messages` has inside ./thread-shell.tsx,
 * and it carries the same obligation on the caller: drop the transcript's
 * portal BEFORE re-rendering this shell, because a layout change recreates the
 * element and a portal left pointing at a detached node keeps its subtree and
 * its store subscription alive.
