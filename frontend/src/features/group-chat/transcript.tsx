/**
 * `#gc-messages` — the group chat transcript, as the only React writer below
 * that host.
 *
 * This is the deck's NAMED-ROW transcript (its "Recipe App · 2 members"
 * screen): a square avatar, a bold name at reading size, a time, and flat
 * content. It is built from @/components/ui/chat.tsx, which is what that
 * module was written for — the bubble transcript in the same file belongs to
 * the agent chat, and the two are different shapes on purpose.
 *
 * ── What React owns, and what it deliberately does not ────────────────
 *
 * React owns every row: the shell, the header, the body, the quote block and
 * the reactions — all of which are DATA on the message, so all of which
 * reconcile. That is the point of the conversion: a reaction toggle used to
 * rebuild one row's `innerHTML`, an edit used to rebuild another's, and a
 * bookmark toggle swapped an icon element in place. All three are store
 * updates now.
 *
 * ONE thing stays a module-filled host, per the controller-host seam in
 * AGENTS.md: `[data-gc-vote-controls]`, the inline vote buttons on a vote row.
 * Its markup is `AppView.voteButtonsHtml` + `voteCountPill` + the merge
 * badges — the Dev screen's own vote renderers, sixteen call sites of them in
 * public/js/app-view.js — re-filled in place by `refreshVoteControls()` from
 * `AppView.voteState`, which arrives on its own schedule. So it is not
 * independently convertible: its ownership boundary is the Dev screen, not
 * this transcript. It is rendered ONCE as an empty host with a constant
 * `className`, so React never writes an attribute the module has since
 * changed — the same rule the dialog islands run under (see
 * ../../lib/legacy-dom.ts).
 *
 * `[data-gc-spec-share]` used to be the second one, and it was never filled by
 * anything — see SpecShareRow below.
 *
 * ── The inline editor is the third, and it is a different shape ───────
 *
 * `GroupChat._startEdit` puts a `.gc-edit` block into a row: it INSERTS a
 * sibling after `.gc-msg-content` and hides that node with an inline
 * `display:none`. It does not write any node React renders — React manages
 * this row's `className` and its body's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, neither of
 * which the editor touches, and an unknown sibling plus an inline style are
 * both things the reconciler leaves alone. The row's key is `m<id>`, so the
 * element itself survives every repaint the editor could overlap with.
 *
 * That is why it stays where it is. What did NOT stay is anything that wrote
 * a node React owns: the save button's icon and attributes, and the two
 * `.gc-msg-content.innerHTML` assignments the edit paths used, all of which
 * are store patches now (`_paintBookmark`, `_patchBody` in group-chat.js).
 * The `innerHTML` ones were not merely redundant — `Body` memoises on the
 * string, so React kept believing the old content and repainted the row from
 * it the next time anything else about the message changed.

 * screen's reply draft) while this block keeps its compact in-transcript
