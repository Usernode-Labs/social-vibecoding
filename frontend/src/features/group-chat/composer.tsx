/**
 * The group chat composer — the staged-reply chip, the attachment error, the
 * pending-upload strip, the form, and the status line above it — as the only
 * React writer below all four, for BOTH composers.
 *
 * ── One renderer, because there was always one renderer ───────────────
 *
 * `_renderQuotePreview`, `_setAttachError`, `_renderAttachStrip` and the two
 * typing writers each began with `thread ? 'gc-thread-…' : 'gc-…'` and then
 * built one piece of markup. Splitting that into a thread component and a
 * general component would have been the first time these two controls could
 * disagree. They take a `scope` instead, which is the same ternary in the same
 * one place — see ./composer-store.ts for why the store has two slots.
 *
 * ── What each side still owns ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The BAR around this is the caller's: ./thread-shell.tsx pins its own to the
 * bottom of the thread panel, ./general-chat.tsx to the bottom of the chat
 * pane, and the two read-only notices are worded and placed differently
 * enough that sharing them would be a change rather than a de-duplication.
 * What is shared is everything between the bar's edges.
 *
 * The LISTENERS are still attached by the module, on the line after the mount:
 * submit, input, keydown, the paperclip, the paste and drag-and-drop wiring,
 * and both autocompletes. They are listeners on nodes — they write no markup —
 * which keeps one owner for the draft, the typing ping, the multi-line submit
 * semantics and the Escape-clears-reply rule.
 *
 * One of them writes an ATTRIBUTE and is fine: `_autoGrowTextarea` sets
 * `style.height` on the field after every keystroke, to grow it to its content
 * and cap it. Nothing here renders a `style` prop, so React never diffs that
 * attribute — the same tolerated overlap the inline message editor's
 * `display:none` runs under, and for the same reason.
