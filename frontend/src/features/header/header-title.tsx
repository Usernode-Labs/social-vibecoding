/**
 * #header-title — the name of where you are, and nothing else.
 *
 * ── It was a button, and is not one any more ──────────────────────────
 *
 * ./app-switcher-chip.tsx made this heading a control: "(name) ⌄", opening
 * a menu that listed every platform destination. That was #1443's answer to
 * a bar with too many glyphs on it, and it held for as long as the menu was
 * the only way to reach anything. The tab bar (features/nav/) carries those
 * destinations now, so the menu behind the name holds the APP's options —
 * and a name that opens a menu about something else is a control whose label
 * lies about what it does. The menu moved to its own button
 * (./platform-mark.tsx); the name went back to being a name.
 *
 * What survives from the chip, unchanged, is everything that was about the
 * NAME rather than about the button:
 *
 *   - the h1 and its className, byte for byte, because
 *     ./use-header-layout.ts toggles `.is-centered` on this node via
 *     classList and a re-rendered class attribute would drop it;
 *   - `pointer-events-none`, so the heading's overlap never eats a tap meant
 *     for a control beside it;
 *   - the SUBTITLE BESIDE the name rather than under it — a destination
 *     inside an app (Board, Activity, a session's lifecycle) says which part
 *     of the app you are in without overwriting which app it is;
 *   - the LOGOTYPE when the name is the platform's own, drawn from the title
 *     string because that is the only fact available at first render. The
 *     chip's header carries the full argument for that test, including which
 *     screens it over-covers and why narrowing it would cost a flicker on
 *     every cold load to fix a screen where the drawing already says the
 *     right name.
 *
 * ── The app strip: a tile, and then the name ──────────────────────────
 *
 * Inside a running app the bar is that app's: close on the left, then its
 * icon and its name, then the bell and the mark. The tile is what makes the
 * difference read at a glance — the same artwork the launcher drew a moment
 * ago, so opening an app and being in it are visibly the same thing — and it
 * is drawn from ../improve/improve-store.js, which already carries the open
 * app's name, icon url and emoji for the panel that used to live in this bar.
 * No new fetch, no new publisher.
 *
 * It renders ONLY inside the app view, from features/nav's `screen`. The
 * store's INITIAL has no screen at all, so the prerendered document and the
 * first client render agree on no tile, and it arrives with the route.
 *
 * ── On the app's Workshop the strip is the app switcher (#2768, #3295) ─
 *
 * The Workshop used to lead with a scope chip — the app's tile, its name and
 * a ⌄ — whose panel listed your other apps. Under this bar that was the same
 * tile and the same name twice, an inch apart. #2768 dropped the chip on a
 * phone and made the bar's tile and name the control there: a button with
 * the ⌄ that opened the same panel. A desktop kept the chip and the bar
 * dropped its tile instead.
 *
 * #3295 (the owner's request) makes the desktop the phone's: "on desktop,
 * put the community selector dropdown in the header, not either above the
 * community hub / workshop tabs or to the left of those if the screen is
 * wide". So the switcher is this bar's AT EVERY WIDTH, and the Workshop no
 * longer draws a chip.
 *
 * WHAT IT OPENS is "Your communities" now (features/workshop/
 * community-switcher.tsx), the same switcher the Communities tab opens when
 * pressed while lit: a sheet on a phone, a menu under this name on a wide
 * window. The in-page "Which project?" panel it used to drop is gone. On the
 * project page this bar wears the community's colour (app.css, "The
 * project's colour"), so the name and ⌄ read as the community's own.
 *
 * ── And on the Communities screen, its switcher (#3271, #852) ──────────
 *
 * The Communities screen led with the same kind of chip, "All ⌄". On a phone
 * it sat under a header that only said "Communities" (which the lit tab
 * already says), costing a whole row, so the header's title became the chip
 * there (#3271), `#header-scope-switch`. #852 makes that every width and
 * drops the chip from the page: the control that says where you are lives
 * in the bar that says it everywhere else. It opens "Your communities", as
 * the app's name does, and it reads "Communities ⌄": the screen's own name,
 * with "All communities" kept for the switcher's first row.
 *
 * The width is a media flag settled in an effect, so the first client render
 * is the prerender's (no button) and nothing here can mismatch hydration; by
 * the time anybody reaches the Communities screen the flag has long since
 * landed. The app's switcher needs no flag: it follows the route, which the
 * prerender does not have either.
