/**
 * The side panel beside a running app, on a desktop-width window — the TOP
 * document's half (the panel's own document runs ./embedded.ts).
 *
 * ── What it is ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * While an app runs on its App tab, the pages ABOUT it — its Workshop, its
 * discussion, a proposal, an issue, a change — and the conversations a
 * notification points at open in a panel beside it instead of replacing it.
 * The app keeps running next to the panel and is never reloaded.
 *
 * ── Why the panel is the platform, framed ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * The platform's screens are singletons behind one router: App._showOnlyScreen
 * shows exactly one root, the running app's iframe and that app's Workshop
 * are two tabs of the same #app-view, the discussion renders into ids the
 * legacy chat module owns, and every store is global. Showing the app and one
 * of those pages at once natively would mean re-architecting the router. So
 * the panel is a same-origin <iframe> of the platform itself at
 * `/?panel=1#<route>`, in an embedded mode that draws no chrome (see
 * lib/side-panel-mode.ts and head.html) — the pages it shows are the real
 * pages, at their phone layout, with no second copy of any of them.
 *
 * ── What this file owns ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   - WHEN a navigation goes to the panel (`canTake`): an app on screen on its
 *     App tab, a desktop-width window, not chromeless, not the native app,
 *     not inside the panel itself.
 *   - The two chokepoints that catch a navigation BEFORE it lands: a
 *     capture-phase click on a link, and (where the browser has the
 *     Navigation API) a script's `location.hash = …`. Both refuse the
 *     navigation, so the top window's history is untouched — reverting a hash
 *     after the fact leaves a dead Back entry. The JavaScript entry points
 *     (App.openAppTab, the Messages store, New change, the agent-session
 *     store) call `take` directly.
 *   - The panel's own history: a stack of the pages opened in it, then the
 *     climb to the list a page belongs to (./routes.ts parentRoute). It is kept
 *     HERE rather than in the browser's session history, because an iframe's
 *     entries are the top window's entries too — and Chromium keeps them after
 *     the frame is gone, as Back presses that do nothing.
 *   - Expand (the page, full width, leaving the app — App._syncParkedApp parks
 *     it) and Close (the panel only).
 *   - Dropping the frame when the app leaves the screen by any route:
 *     App._syncPlatformTabs, the one place that decides whether the running
 *     app is on screen, calls `appPresence`.
 *   - The top window's `?side=<route>` (SIDE_PARAM): the page the panel is
 *     showing, kept in the address with replaceState so a reload — or Back
 *     to the app — brings the panel back where it was. Written while the
 *     panel is open, removed when it closes or goes with the app.
