/**
 * The legacy → React seam for the staging-preview and visual-compare overlays
 * (#1085 chunk H, step 1).
 *
 * `public/js/app-view.js` is a classic script that runs before this bundle, so
 * it calls by name: `AppView._staging().setLoader(…)` resolves
 * `window.UsernodeReact.staging`. Published at module scope (main.tsx imports
 * this above `hydrateRoot`) for the same reason the Dev board's bridge is —
 * these calls must not queue, because the overlay is opened from a user gesture
 * that reads the DOM on its next line.
 *
 * app-view.js keeps an equivalent DOM adapter (`AppView._stagingDom`) for
 * contexts where this bundle is not present at all — the Node-side render tests
 * load app-view.js as a classic script into a stubbed document. Both adapters
 * implement the same API; exactly one of them is live in any given context, so
 * there is never a second writer for these nodes.
 *
 * The bridge bodies themselves live in ./staging-bridge.js, which imports no
 * React: that is what lets tests/staging-iframe-identity.test.js drive the real
 * bridge. This file adds the two React-dependent halves.
 *
 * The `typeof window !== 'undefined'` guard is load-bearing: the SSG prerender
 * pass evaluates this whole module graph in Node.
